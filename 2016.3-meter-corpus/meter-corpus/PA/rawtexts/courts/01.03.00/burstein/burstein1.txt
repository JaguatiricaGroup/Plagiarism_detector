COMPOSER CHALLENGED OVER `DISAPPROVAL' AT CONCERT<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
Composer Keith Burstein, seeking damages from The Times which accused him of
organising hecklers to wreck performances by modernists, told the High Court
today that he did ``voice disapproval'' at the end of a performance of Sir
Harrison Birtwistle's work.<
Justin Rushbrooke, representing the newspaper in the libel case, asked whether
Mr Burstein agreed that he ``heckled and booed'' at the end of the concert at
Covent Garden in March 1994.<
``This could have upset members of the audience? It could have wrecked the
concert for someone particularly keen on Birtwistle's work?<
``Was the Times diarist not entitled to criticise this behaviour?''<
Mr Burstein replied that it was ``perfectly acceptable to voice pleasure or
disapproval'' at the end of a concert but he would never tolerate anyone who
disrupted during the middle of a performance.<
``It was designed to provoke people into thinking about modern atonal music,''
he replied.<
The Times diary item, published in June 1997, referred to a forthcoming ``in
memoriam'' concert, A Live Flame, for the late Labour Party leader, John Smith.<
It read: ``The music is by Keith Burstein, an aggressively self-righteous,
rather slushy composer who used to organise bands of hecklers to go about
wrecking performances of modern atonal music, particularly anything by Sir
Harrison Birtwistle.''<
Mr Burstein said he had won acclaim for his conducting of works by modern
composers, including Birtwistle, in the 1980s, but had decided in 1990 that the
way forward was not ``clashing, complex and dissonant'' music.<
He said he now believed music should be ``melodious, beautiful and lyrical''
and he was now drawing on the traditions of Mozart, Beethoven and Elgar for his
inspiration.<
``Music is of ultimate importance to me and has been my whole life.''<
Mr Burstein said he had been ``flattered'' by Baroness Smith's reaction to his
work and was looking forward to the second performance of A Live Flame before an
audience including most of the new Labour Cabinet.<
He said he was ``shocked and dismayed'' when he read the article.<
``I could not believe it. I looked at it in disbelief as the implications of
what had been written sank in. If people believed what they had said I had lost
my personal and professional integrity.''<
Asked whether he had disrupted a concert, he replied: ``Anyone who did that
would have to be virtually mad.<
``It would be a criminal activity, a fascist thing, to try to prevent people
hearing music.''<
