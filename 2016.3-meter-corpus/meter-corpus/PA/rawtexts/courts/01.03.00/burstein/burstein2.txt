                16:40 01/03/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Burstein
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Rushbrooke said The Times had offered to pay Mr Burstein's legal costs and a
sum of #500 to settle the dispute, but he had rejected this.<
Mr Burstein said he felt the offer was ``a lot of rubbish'' as the article had
accused him of being someone who organises other people to ``smash up other
people's work''.<
``I felt from the start that what you had done to me was so serious, I wanted
this matter to be brought before a jury. You had lied about me in the public
domain and I wanted a jury to decide this matter.''<
Judge Richard Walker will sum up tomorrow morning before the jury decides on
the amount of damages.<
The judge has already ruled, as a matter of law, that the words complained of
are libellous.<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
