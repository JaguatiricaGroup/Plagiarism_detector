PHARMACISTS FINED OVER BABY DEATH BLUNDER<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
Two Boots the Chemist pharmacists were fined today after admitting making a
catastrophic mistake and mixing a solution of peppermint water which was so
strong it killed a newborn baby boy.<
Lisa Taylor-Lloyd, 27, and Ziad Khattab, 25, pleaded guilty at Chester Crown
Court to supplying the solution which had 20 times the amount of chloroform that
was needed.<
Mr Justice Forbes, who agreed that a charge of manslaughter, which the pair
denied, be dropped, said it was a terrible tragic case and ordered Taylor Lloyd
to pay #1,000 and Khattab #750.<
The hearing follows the death of baby Matthew Young from Runcorn, Cheshire,
after he was given a solution of peppermint water from Hallwood Health Centre in
the town in April 1998.<
Matthew was just four days old when his GP prescribed the medicine for wind. <
The court heard how his mother Collette Jackson, 23, took what should have
been a harmless substance home. But when it was dropped into his mouth from a
syringe by his father Neil Young, 24, Matthew began to squirm, then turned blue
after suffering a heart attack.<
He was rushed to hospital by ambulance and transferred to Alder Hey Children's
Hospital where he was treated in intensive care, but despite efforts to save him
he died having suffered severe brain damage.<
A pathologist certified he had died from a cardiac arrest resulting from the
inhalation of chloroform.<
Mr Peter Hughes, QC, prosecuting told the court that the medicine was prepared
by Khattab who was under the supervision of Taylor Lloyd.<
He said: ``The fundamental mistake that Mr Khattab made was to confuse
chloroform double strength water with chloroform concentrate, which as a
solution is 20 times stronger.''<
Matthew, who was born a healthy baby at Warrington District Hospital was
prescribed 150 millilitres of peppermint water which had to be made up by a
chemist.<
The court heard that this was unusual as most medications are now supplied
already prepared by large drug companies.<
Mr Hughes told the court that the formula for peppermint water could be found
in the pharmacy in a large white book which was both misleading and out of date,
as the form of chloroform used was no longer stocked and the recipe was for a
200ml dose.<
The court heard that the procedures at the Boots branch differed from a
hospital pharmacy and that Taylor Lloyd, of Kestrel Drive, Crewe, was not
qualified to tutor trainee Khattab, of Albert Road, Eccles, Greater Manchester.<
Prosecuting Peter Hughes QC also said that Khattab would not have been aware
of the different dilutions of chloroform used to make of peppermint water and
there was nothing on the bottle to warn him.<
The judge said:  The death of Matthew Young on April 28, 1998, he was only
four days old, was a terrible tragedy. It should never have happened.'' <
``He died as a result of ingesting what should have been a harmless mixture
intended to deal with nothing more than serious colic and wind.''<
He said he accepted the pair had had a charge of manslaughter hanging over
them and that their futures as chemists were uncertain.  Both chemists are still
employed at Boots although Khattab has not worked since August 1998.<
``Having said all that,'' he added: ``It must follow that each of you by your
pleas of guilty do accept that on the day in question each of you failed to show
diligence in the preparation and dispensing of this particular mixture which led
sadly to Matthew's death.''<
The judge said he was satisfied community pharmacies now operated the same
strict guidance which applies in hospitals and that Boots had revised its

procedures.<
Matthew's parents were present in court but declined to comment.  It is
understood they are considering civil action against the high street store.<
A spokesman for Boots the Chemist said: ``Our deepest sympathies continue to
be with Matthew's parents and family at this time. <
``We can't begin to imagine the grief that they have been through over the
last few months.  Immediately following the incident we reviewed all our
procedures in this area and I am pleased to note that the judge complimented us
on this.<
``What we now need to do is find out whether there are other lessons, and if
there are further lessons, to implement them.''<
