PHARMACISTS FINED OVER BLUNDER WHICH KILLED BABY<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
Two pharmacists who worked for Boots the chemist were today fined after
admitting making a catastrophic mistake when preparing medicine which killed a
new-born baby.<
Chemist Lisa Taylor Lloyd, 27, was fined #1,000 and trainee Zaid Khattab, 25,
was fined #750 after they pleaded guilty to supplying peppermint water ``not of
the nature and quality specified on the description'' to four-day-old Matthew
Young.<
Matthew, who was given the medicine from Boots at Hallwood Health Centre in
Runcorn, Merseyside, to cure wind, died two and a half weeks later in April
1998. The solution was 20 times too strong.<
Mr Justice Forbes, who accepted guilty pleas on a lesser charge after a count
of manslaughter was dropped at Chester Crown Court this morning, said this was a
terrible, tragic case.<
He said: ``The death of Matthew Young on April 28, 1998, he was only four days
old, was a terrible tragedy. It should never have happened.''<
He said Matthew died as a result of taking something which should have been a
harmless mixture intended to deal with nothing more than serious colic and
wind.<
The judge said it was important to stress that the offence the pair admitted
to did not mean they were criminally responsible for the boy's death but added
that the mixture dispensed by the defendants did lead to his tragic and untimely
death.<
He said instead of having a healthy baby boy Matthew's parents had his
premature death put on them which must have been beyond their wildest
imagination, their worst nightmare.<
He said: ``I repeat however that I accept that neither of you are criminally
responsible for that death.''<
The judge said he took into account that the pair had pleaded to the lesser
charge at the earliest opportunity and accepted that they had exemplary
characters and were each at the threshold of professional careers. He said
pharmacy was a very important branch of health care and that each of them had
worked hard to get where they were. <
The judge said Taylor Lloyd and Khattab were both victims of what had
happened.<
He said that in his view there were two matters in particular that led to the
terrible tragedy.<
Firstly, he said, was the different approach that community pharmacies had to
hospital pharmacies.<
And secondly he blamed the formula book that was used to prepare the mixture.
He said he was satisfied that if it were not for the two matters the tragedy
would not have occurred, that neither of the defendants would be standing before
him, nor would Matthew's parents be grieving. <
He said he also accepted the mitigation that the pair had manslaughter charges
hanging over them and that their future in pharmacy was uncertain. He said they
would have to draw strength of character not only for their own lives but for
the burden of responsibility over what had happened.<
He said: ``I also accept that each of you are genuinely and profoundly
remorseful and I have no doubt that each of you would earnestly desire to turn
the clock back and I accept that each of you has been deeply affected by this
tragedy. <
The judge said that if he had to identify something of benefit that had come
out of what had happened is that hospital and community pharmacies now both
practice the strict guidance over trainees preparing such mixtures.<
But he added: ``Having said all that it must follow that each of you by
entering pleas of guilty do accept that on the day in question each of you
failed to show diligence in the preparation and dispensing of this particular
mixture which led sadly and tragically to Matthew's death.''<
