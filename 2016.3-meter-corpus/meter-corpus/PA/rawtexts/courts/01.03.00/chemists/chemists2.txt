Mr Justice Forbes accepted pleas for the lesser charge after hearing
representations from prosecuting counsel Peter Hughes QC.<
Mr Hughes said that procedures at the Boots branch differed from those in the
hospital pharmacy and that Taylor-Lloyd, of Kestrel Drive, Crewe, was not
qualified to train Kattab, of Albert Road, Eccles, Greater Manchester.<
He also said that Kattab would not have been aware of the different dilutions
of chloroform used to make peppermint oil - and there was nothing on the bottle
to warn him.<
Mr Hughes said that the Royal Pharmaceutical Society issued a warning in its
journal after the tragic event for pharmacists to check their work. But the
Society added that this amounted to no more than emphasising good practice.<
Mr Justice Forbes said: ``It is an extremely sad and tragic case for all
concerned. One's heart goes out to the parents of the boy who died so tragically
and so young.''<
The case was adjourned until 2.15pm.<
