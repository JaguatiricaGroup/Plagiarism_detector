He said: ``The death of Matthew Young on April 28, 1998, he was only four days
old, was a terrible tragedy. It should never have happened.''<
He said Matthew died as a result of taking something which should have been a
harmless mixture intended to deal with nothing more than serious colic and
wind.<
The judge said it was important to stress that the offence the pair admitted
to did not mean they were criminally responsible for the boy's death but added
that the mixture dispensed by the defendants did lead to his tragic and untimely
death.<
He said instead of having a healthy baby boy Matthew's parents had his
premature death put on them which must have been beyond their wildest
imagination, their worst nightmare.<
He said: ``I repeat however that I accept that neither of you are criminally
responsible for that death.''<
The judge said he took into account that the pair had pleaded to the lesser
charge at the earliest opportunity and accepted that they had exemplary
characters and were each at the threshold of professional careers. He said
pharmacy was a very important branch of health care and that each of them had
worked hard to get where they were. <
