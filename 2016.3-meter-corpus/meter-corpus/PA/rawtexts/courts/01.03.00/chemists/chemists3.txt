Mr Hughes went on to say: ``This is an extremely sad and tragic case which arose
out of the death of a very young boy.<
``Matthew Young died as a result of a catastrophic mistake of the preparation
of medicine that had been prescribed for the treatment of infantile colic.''<
Mr Hughes said the medicine was prepared by Kattab, who was under the
supervision of Taylor Lloyd.<
``The fundamental mistake that Mr Kattab made was to confuse chloroform water
in its double strength form with concentrated chloroform which as a solution is
20 times stronger.''<
Matthew, who was born a healthy baby at Warrington General Hospital, was
prescribed 150 millilitres of peppermint water which had to be made up by a
chemist.<
The court heard that this was unusual as most medications are now supplied
already prepared by large drug companies.<
Mr Hughes told the court that the formula for peppermint water could be found
in the pharmacy in a large white book which was both misleading and out of date.
He said: ``As I have already said the formula in the book was out of date for
this reason ... double strength chloroform water is no longer in common use and
is not stocked in Hallwood Pharmacy.''<
Mr Hughes said it was now necessary to dilute the concentrated form of the
chemical with pure water.<
He explained that not only had Kattab had to make up the chloroform water, he
also had to reduce the measures as Matthew had only been prescribed 150
millilitres.<
Mr Hughes continued: ``The medicine took some 10 to 15 minutes to prepare. As
to what went catastrophically wrong during that fateful 10 to 15 minutes we have
the accounts of the defendants.''<
He told the court that during police interviews, Kattab said the formula book
was ``very misleading''. He told police: ``There seems to be lots of numbers all
over the place. I couldn't quite make head nor tail or it.''<
Mr Hughes said written in small print by the side of the formula a previous
pharmacist had written instructions on how to dilute chloroform but had Kattab
seen it he must not have thought it significant.<
Mr Hughes said Taylor Lloyd had failed to check the trainee's work. ``When he
had finished she gave the medicine in a brown bottle to Matthew's mother
together with a small syringe to measure out the individual 2.5 millilitre
doses. She initialled the box on the label certifying that she had checked
it.''<
Matthew's mother took the medicine home and his father measured out the dose
into the syringe but Mr Hughes said after just a few drops Matthew stopped
breathing and suffered a cardiac arrest.<
He was rushed to hospital by ambulance and transferred to Alder Hey Children's
Hospital where he was treated in intensive care but despite all efforts to save
him he died, having suffered severe brain damage.<
A pathologist certified he had died from a cardiac arrest resulting from the
inhalation of chloroform.<
The court heard that the bottle of medicine was analysed and the solution had
separated, with the alcohol rising to the top and chloroform sinking to the
bottom.<
During her police interview, Taylor Lloyd said she had given the job to Kattab
because she thought it was good experience for him. She said she had seen him
discussing the measures with a colleague at the pharmacy. And when asked to
describe his competence, she said professionally she had seen better.<
