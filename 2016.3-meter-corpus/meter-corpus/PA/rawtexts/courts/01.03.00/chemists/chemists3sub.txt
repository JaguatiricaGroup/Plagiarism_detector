The judge said Taylor Lloyd and Kattab were both victims of what had happened.<
He said that in his view there were two matters in particular that led to the
terrible tragedy.<
Firstly, he said, was the different approach that community pharmacies had to
hospital pharmacies.<
And secondly he blamed the formula book that was used to prepare the mixture.
He said he was satisfied that if it were not for the two matters the tragedy
would not have occurred, that neither of the defendants would be standing before
him, nor would Matthew's parents be grieving. <
He said he also accepted the mitigation that the pair had manslaughter charges
hanging over them and that their future in pharmacy was uncertain. He said they
would have to draw strength of character not only for their own lives but for
the burden of responsibility over what had happened.<
He said: ``I also accept that each of you are genuinely and profoundly
remorseful and I have no doubt that each of you would earnestly desire to turn
the clock back and I accept that each of you has been deeply affected by this
tragedy. <
The judge said that if he had to identify something of benefit that had come
out of what had happened is that hospital and community pharmacies now both
practice the strict guidance over trainees preparing such mixtures.<
But he added: ``Having said all that it must follow that each of you by
entering pleas of guilty do accept that on the day in question each of you
failed to show diligence in the preparation and dispensing of this particular
mixture which led sadly and tragically to Matthew's death.''<
