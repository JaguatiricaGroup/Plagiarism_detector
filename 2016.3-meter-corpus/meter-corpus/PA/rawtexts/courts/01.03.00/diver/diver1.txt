DIVER IN HORROR ACCIDENT SETTLES FOR #115,000<
By Mark Wilkinson, PA News<
A deep-sea diver who suffered a broken back in an accident hundreds of feet
under the North Sea has received #115,000 in an out-of-court settlement, it was
revealed today.<
Andrew Binney, 46, fractured his back in two places after a crane on a support
ship lowered a metal lifting frame on top of him while working off the coast of
Denmark.<
Despite the agony of a crushed spine he inched his way back to a diving bell
and then had to wait three-and-a-half days in a decompression chamber before he
could be treated.<
He returned to work six-months after the accident in 1992 but after two years
of experiencing back pain and discomfort on dives, doctors declared him medially
unfit to continue.<
He took out a civil action against his former employer, Aberdeen-based
Rockwater, claiming #300,000 in lost earnings.<
The company argued that the accident was Mr Binney's fault because he had
breached safety procedures by working underneath the lifting frame.<
But Mr Binney, of Crookes, Sheffield, claimed the company was to blame because
his supervisor failed to check whether he was under the frame before passing on
his request to lower the crane.<
The #115,000 settlement was agreed out of court yesterday, halting proceedings
in Sheffield High Court and ending an eight-year legal fight.<
The court was told the settlement meant the blame was split between the
company and Mr Binney.<
After leaving his job, Mr Binney, who has a partner and two children, was
forced to sell his #200,000 detached home, his cars and a horse to make ends
meet.<
He said: ``My lifestyle completely changed. Divers can earn up to #100,000 a
year. My family went from enjoying a very healthy salary to zero without any
sort of planning - it was a real shock to the system.<
''I'm not saying we are on the streets but our lives have changed because of
this accident. What I have been given is the equivalent of a year's salary.''<
He now works part-time for Sainsbury's Homebase and is studying for a degree
in environmental conservation at Sheffield Hallam University.<
A spokesman for Rockwater said the company had no comment to make.<
