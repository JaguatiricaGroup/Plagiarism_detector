JUDGMENT DAY TOMORROW FOR SOCCER FANS IN SEATS ROW<
By Dylan Dronfield, PA News<
Football fans who brought legal action against their club claiming they are
being unlawfully moved from their seats will be told the result tomorrow, a
judge said today.<
Sitting at Newcastle High Court, Mr Justice Blackburne said he would make his
judgment at noon tomorrow in the case which six Newcastle United fans have
brought against the club.<
Today counsel gave closing addresses before the judge adjourned the case.<
Jonathan Crystal, barrister for the Save Our Seats campaign, told the court
the fans believed #500 bonds which they bought in 1994 as season ticket holders
should have guaranteed their seats for 10 years.<
He said they started their legal fight soon after receiving a letter from the
club in October last year which said they would have to move seats to make way
for a corporate hospitality unit or pay #1,350 to stay put.<
He said: ``For these fans this is their life. They want the seats where they
are. For them it's everything and that's what they were promised. They are
entitled to come here and say that.''<
Nick Stewart QC, who represents the club, said small print in the bond meant
the club was able to move the supporters ``in exceptional circumstances''.<
He said the plan to move the fans was part of a #45 million redevelopment St
James's Park, which would create 15,000 more seats for supporters, taking the
capacity to 51,000.<
The corporate hospitality unit would bring in around #3 million a year and the
revenue it generated would help to pay off the redevelopment costs, he said.<
Mr Justice Blackburne has heard that the club needed to move 4,000 fans to the
newly built upper tier of the ground to make way for corporate hospitality
units.<
Of the 4,000 fans being asked to move, the court heard that 2,134 are bond
holders. Mr Crystal said the result of the case would mean other bond holders
would feel their seats could also be in danger.<
During the case England coach Kevin Keegan gave written evidence in which he
said he believed the bonds meant the holder would remain in that seat for 10
years.<
His statement said: ``There was no doubt that from the overall promotion of
the bond scheme and the way it was sold that the bond holders would retain their
own personal seats for 10 years.<
``It is my belief that the purchasers of United bonds are entitled to their
own designated seats for the remaining life of the bond.''<
The case adjourned until noon tomorrow.<
