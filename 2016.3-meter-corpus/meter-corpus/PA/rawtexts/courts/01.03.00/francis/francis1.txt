ANTI-DRUGS CHAMPION JAILED AFTER HEROIN FIND<
By Damien Brook, PA News<
A man who was paid from the public purse to help solve the drug problem in a
major British city was today starting a seven-year sentence for possessing
heroin.<
David Francis, 37, West Bridgford, Nottingham, who was once thought to be a
pillar of the community in Nottingham, pleaded guilty to having half a kilo of
44% pure heroin _ with a street value of up to #80,000 _ with intent to supply.<
He had formerly been a high-profile figure in the city's Crack Awareness Team
_ an organisation blessed by the Home Office and funded in part by the national
Association for the Prevention of Addiction.<
A man Francis had helped wean off crack cocaine had become an active
participant in the operation to supply drugs, Nottingham Crown Court heard
today.<
Stephen Warner, 33, Wollaton, Nottingham, today admitted possession of half a
kilo of very pure heroin with intent to supply. He was jailed for five years.<
A third man, Christopher Powell, 21, of Thornton Heath, Surrey, was sentenced
to five and a half years after admitting the same charge.<
Andrew Easteal, prosecuting, said police had suspected Francis might be
involved in drugs and had begun to investigate him early last year.<
He said: ``Police became aware that a car, a VW Golf, was arriving in
Nottingham from London. In the car was half a kilo of heroin.<
``The car had been hired by Francis and it went to a flat he rented.''<
Police moved in.<
Mr Easteal said: ``On the landing they found Francis with a mobile phone. His
pockets were quite literally bulging with #5,620.''<
Warner was found in a bedroom with the drugs and Powell was in the kitchen of
the flat in February last year.<
Also at the premises were two other men. One named Joseph Edwards, of The
Meadows, Nottingham, was today released with no evidence being offered in his
case.<
The other, Vance Yeboah, was Streatham, London, is believed to have fled the
country and has yet to be tried.<
Sentencing Francis, Judge Dudley Bennett said: ``Your previous involvement in
trying to stop drugs means you ought to have known the misery that they cause.''
<
So far a police operation, named Odin, targeting drug dealers in the city has
seen 132 people being prosecuted.<
Det Insp John Hendley, who led the operation, said today: ``We invested a lot
of time and resources into this operation and I am delighted it has culminated
in him pleading guilty.''<
He added: ``We are delighted this man has been removed. Francis has been a
thorn in our side for a long time, but more importantly than that he has been
damaging, with the drugs he brought in, the community we all live in.''<
