(Corrected repetition making clear in par 3 Arlene Fraser was last seen waving
her children off to school.) MISSING WIFE _ HUSBAND GETS 18 MONTHS FOR ASSAULT<
By Tariq Tahir, PA News<
A husband whose wife has not been seen for nearly two years was today jailed
for 18 months for a life-threatening assault on her shortly before she
vanished.<
Nat Fraser, 41, pleaded guilty at the High Court in Edinburgh last month to
seizing his wife Arlene's neck and endangering her life in their house in Elgin
on March 22, 1998.<
Mrs Fraser has not been seen since she dropped her children Jamie, 12, and
seven-year-old Natalie off at school a month later, on April 28, 1998.<
Her disappearance sparked a huge police hunt which took detectives across
Britain and even abroad in an attempt to find her.<
Fraser was originally charged with attempting to murder his wife, but the
charge was dropped after he pleaded guilty to the assault.<
There was considerable media interest in the case following Mrs Fraser's
disappearance.<
Fraser's defence team tried last month to get the attempted murder charge
thrown out because of what it said was adverse publicity.<
During today's hearing Mr Neil Murray QC, Fraser's advocate, once again
criticised media coverage of the case, claiming at one point that the press had
behaved in the manner of Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels.<
Outside the court today, relatives of Mrs Fraser said they were happy with the
sentence.<
But they believed Arlene was dead and were determined to find her body.<
Mr Fraser's sister, Carol Gillies, 37, said: ``We thought he was going to get
three months but he probably won't serve 18 months. This inquiry is very much
alive _ we would like to see people come forward with information.''<
