  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Murray said that on the night of the incident Fraser's wife had been out
drinking until the early hours of the morning.<
``An argument ensued. It would appear that there were difficulties in the
circumstances of the marriage with both sides. But the parties kept together for
the sake of the children.''<
Fraser was concerned his wife would not be able to attend a Mother's Day lunch
he had arranged on that day.<
``The children had made gifts and a card for their mother, which they left
under the pillow to be opened when she returned home. It's this general
background that caused him to snap,'' said Mr Murray.<
``If one looks back in time one clear influence is that he envisaged the
situation in which his children wished to see their mother as early as possible.
Immediately after this incident there was clear concern about what had
happened.<
``I would say that what we've heard is an inexcusable loss of temper and
action which were entirely out of character and which were followed immediately
by an indication of concern and remorse.''<
Mr Murray said that when Fraser was interviewed by police he immediately
admitted the assault.<
``At that early stage there's an acceptance of responsibility and an
acceptance that what he has done was unacceptable,'' said Mr Murray.<
The court heard there was considerable publicity when Fraser was charged with
attempted murder shortly after his wife's disappearance.<
``I have been unfortunate to have read the matter that had been published in
the media,'' said Mr Murray.<
``With the exception of a number of local journalists and court reporters, the
coverage has hounded Mr Fraser and his family.<
``It would do justice to the harpies of ancient Greece. It is something that
has profoundly affected Mr Fraser. The speculation that has been indulged in has
caused considerable distress to his family.''<
Mr Murray said that among the references presented to the court was one from a
Conservative local councillor who testified to Mr Fraser's good character.<
But jailing Fraser, Lord Morrison said a custodial sentence was inevitable.<
``This is a nasty and wholly unprovoked assault. With regards to the evidence,
I accept little of what was said about your wife's condition when she arrived in
the early hours of the morning.<
``I do accept that you have shown remorse and you recognised your guilt. I
accept that the assault was out of character on the basis of the references
which have been provided to me.<
``Taking into account all the matters put before me, I consider that the
comparatively short period of custody would be appropriate.''<
