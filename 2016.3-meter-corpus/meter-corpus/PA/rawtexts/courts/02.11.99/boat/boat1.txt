PARENTS WELCOME 85-YEAR JAIL SENTENCE ON SEA CAPTAIN'S MILLIONAIRE KILLER<
By Nick Allen, PA News<
The parents of a British sea captain who died with five other people when a
Texan millionaire drove into his boat today welcomed a sentence of 85 years in
prison for their son's killer.<
Simon Prankerd, who was 32, was skippering the cabin cruiser `Bill It' off
Fort Lauderdale, Florida in November 1997 when millionaire property developer
Stanley Cameron, 58, crashed into it in his boat Merrymaker.<
Captain Prankerd's mother Patricia, 61, from St Mawes, Cornwall, tonight said
she was satisfied with the ``hefty sentence'' imposed by an American court,
which effectively means Cameron will spend the rest of his life in jail.<
In an emotional letter to the court, Captain Prankerd's father Peter, a
retired Naval officer, had said that Cameron deserved to spend the rest of his
life in jail.<
He told how the shock of his son's death had turned the lives of his family
upside down.<
In 1975, when Simon was 10, his brother Timothy, eight, and sister Elizabeth,
12, the family had set off around the world in a yacht for five years, surviving
piracy and one of the worst storms in the north Atlantic in living memory.<
Simon grew up on the ocean, later studying and qualifying in boat building and
yacht design in England and becoming a certificated captain and professional
boat pilot much respected by his peers.<
``His love was his family and the ocean,'' wrote Mr Prankerd.<
``He was loved and respected the world over by all who knew him. He was a very
gentle giant, being a quiet, sober Christian young man.<
``He rarely if ever criticised people and to know him was to love him. He was
spiritually mature lifetimes beyond his years.<
``Having endured so many dangers with his family on their global voyagings the
family were at all times very close and united.<
``His untimely death on the placid waters of the Intacoastal Waterway came not
only as a deep shock but somewhat of a paradoxical, bizarre aspect, having
survived such challenging dangers on the oceans.<
``His sudden death turned all our lives upside down. We miss him terribly,
achingly and there will always be tears mixed with joy, and laughter.''<
The Prankerd family did not attend the trial in America but Elizabeth and
Timothy assisted greatly with investigations, collating evidence in liaison with
the District Attorney and interviewing witnesses and discovering facts.<
They also inspected the two boats involved in the crash viewing underwater
videos and photographs taken by crime scene investigators.<
``Having been through this, they frankly could not face going to the trial to
watch truths being twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools or to hear Cameron
plead his innocence'' wrote Mr Prankerd.<
Explaining to the court the impact of his son's death Mr Prankerd wrote:
``Human misery, devastation, carnage and trauma left in the Cameron wake will
not simply float out on the tide or be lost to sight as so much flotsam and
jetsam on some distant shore.''<
He added that it was a ``feckless, selfish and arrogant act having
incalculable ramifications, being an act knowingly perpetrated, unreasoning,
unconscionable and wholly careless of the consequences.''<
