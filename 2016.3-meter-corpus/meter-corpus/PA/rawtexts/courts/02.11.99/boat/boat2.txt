Cameron, of Fort Lauderdale, showed little emotion when the sentence was
handed down by Circuit Judge Joyce Julian.<
State sentencing guidelines had called for 70 years or more after he was
convicted of drunken-driving manslaughter of six people _ Captain Prankerd and
five Americans.<
Prankerd, a licensed charter captain, was hired to pilot the boat that night
so the others, in town for a contractor's convention, could drink and
socialise.<
Cameron's lawyer, Kevin Kulik, said he would appeal against the conviction and
sentence.<
During the sentencing hearing, members of the victims' families said they
understood that Cameron did not mean to hurt or kill anyone, but said they were
upset at his apparent lack of remorse and for what they called extremely
reckless behaviour.<
Marilyn Draper, whose husband, Donald, was among those killed, looked Cameron
directly in the eye as she described sending her husband on a business trip. He
never returned and has since missed his children's college graduations, she
said.<
``This is him before you,'' Mrs Draper continued, pointing to her husband in a
family photograph.<
Then her hand moved to another snapshot, this one of Draper's cemetery plot.
``And this is his grave stone _ after you.''<
A victim's son, Gerard Wypyszynski, said he was ``very relieved. It's been a
long two years.''<
``I have sympathy for all the families, even Mr Cameron's family,'' Wypyszyski
said outside court. ``It's a tragedy that didn't need to happen.''<
Cameron also faces civil damage suits stemming from the crash.<
