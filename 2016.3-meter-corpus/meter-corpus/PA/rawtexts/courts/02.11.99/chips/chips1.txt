DIET OF CHIPS BOY BALLOONED TO 22 STONE, COURT TOLD<
By PA News Reporter<
A teenager told a child cruelty trial jury how his weight ballooned to 22
stone after his parents fed him on a diet of chips.<
Richard Thomas claimed his businessman father Christopher Grant and stepmother
Meryl Grant forced him to live on junk food because no fresh food was kept in
the family house.<
He also claimed he was subjected to physical abuse and held to ridicule
because of his weight.<
Richard told the trial at Cardiff Crown Court: ``Occasionally I ate pasty and
chips or jumbo sausage with chips _ but mainly it was just chips.<
``I got used to it. I would wait for my parents to come back in the evening
for our meal. We would regularly live on chippy meals.<
``Food was never prepared in the house ever. Most nights they would come home
with a whole load of chips. I used to be 22 stone when I was 12.''<
He added: ``My father would punch me almost every day and Meryl would join in
by kicking me. But I was such a fat kid I could hardly feel the kicks at all.<
``My name in the house was `stupid fat bastard'.''<
Christopher Grant, 45, and Meryl Grant, 43, denied three counts of cruelty
against the youngster and were freed after a witness withdrew from giving
evidence to the court.<
Prosecutor Susan Ferrier said they were not offering further evidence in the
case and Recorder of Cardiff Michael Gibbon QC formally found the couple not
guilty of the charges.<
They declined to comment as they left the court.<
The Grants, of Sully, south Wales, had been charged with cruelty to a child by
regular violent attacks, cruelty by failing to provide adequate food, clothing
and accommodation and cruelty by constantly referring to him in a derogatory
fashion.<
The case ended before they were able to give evidence in their defence.<
Earlier, Mrs Ferrier had told the trial: ``No proper food was provided.
Instead he was fed regularly chips over and over again from a chip shop on an
almost daily basis.<
``The only food kept in the kitchen was bread, butter and jam.<
``Richard regularly suffered violence and once his father had knocked him to
the floor Meryl would join in and kick him.''<
