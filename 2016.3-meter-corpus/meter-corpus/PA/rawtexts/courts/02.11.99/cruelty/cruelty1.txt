CRUEL FARMER JAILED<
By Nick Allen, PA News<
A man dubbed one of Britain's cruellest farmers by the RSPCA was today sent to
prison for five and a half months and banned from keeping animals for life.<
Roger Baker, 57, from Ventongimps Common, near Truro, Cornwall, pleaded guilty
to animal cruelty charges.<
Truro Magistrates Court heard he had been sent to prison seven times in the
past 30 years for similar offences.<
RSPCA inspector Rob Skinner said: ``Roger Baker is one of the most
persistently cruel men the RSPCA has ever had to deal with.<
``He's been prosecuted, I believe, more times for animal cruelty than any
other man since this legislation was introduced in 1911.<
``He is a cruel and callous man who doesn't care for his stock. There are so
many decent farmers out there and he degrades them and the industry.''<
