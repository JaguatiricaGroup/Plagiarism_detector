  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The latest prosecution followed RSPCA visits to Baker's fields in February when
they found some sheep dead and others emaciated.<
Some were so badly looked after they were unable to run without falling over
and others had ruptured eyes - 53 had to be destroyed immediately.<
Cattle were found walking in mud up to their abdomens.<
Baker pleaded guilty to 17 charges of causing unnecessary suffering and
distress to 259 sheep and 15 cattle while already serving a lifetime ban from
keeping sheep which was imposed in 1997.<
He also pleaded guilty to four charges of failure to dispose of the carcasses
of 13 sheep and one calf and to keeping sheep while disqualified.<
Baker accused the RSPCA and Ministry of Agriculture inspectors of ``murdering
his sheep'' and claimed the animals were his wife's responsibility.<
He also said he could not remember the last time he went to see them.<
The court heard that Baker was struggling under the tough economic conditions
affecting farmers and he was ``doing the best with limited means available in
very difficult circumstances.''<
Expressing satisfaction with the sentence, Mr Skinner, who led the RSPCA
investigation, said Baker had showed a ``chilling disregard'' for animal welfare
and had caused ``animal suffering on a massive scale''.<
``Roger Baker is the most consistently cruel man we have ever dealt with,'' he
said.<
``Despite numerous court appearances, prison sentences, fines and other
punishments he has failed to learn his lesson or change his behaviour. This is
sheer, wilful cruelty without a conscience.''<
Baker was imprisoned for six months for cruelty to sheep in 1997 and received
another prison sentence in June this year after again being convicted of causing
unnecessary suffering to sheep.<
