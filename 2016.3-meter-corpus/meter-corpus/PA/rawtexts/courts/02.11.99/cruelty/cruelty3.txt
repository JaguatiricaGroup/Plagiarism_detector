(reopens)<
Magistrates were shown video evidence of sheep so weak they fell over when
they attempted to run.<
The court was also told there was practically no grazing for the sheep on the
land on which Baker kept them and virtually the whole flock of more than 250
animals had been caused unnecessary suffering.<
The prosecution was a joint one by the RSPCA, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, Devon and Cornwall Police and Cornwall Trading Standards.<
Welcoming the sentence, Inspector Skinner said the flock of sheep was the
worst he had seen in his life, adding that their condition had been
``appalling.''<
He said the RSPCA was not ``anti-farming'' but that Baker had ``tarred the
good name of farming'' at a time when the industry was struggling.<
``He has been offered a lot of help by us and MAFF and not taken it,'' he
said.<
``I'm very pleased with the sentence, a complete animal ban is the best we
could have hoped for and hopefully it will stop him this time.<
``We can only hope that his prison sentence will make him realise that he
cannot ignore the disqualification order which has been imposed.''<
He said the sheep had suffered conditions including sheep scab, foot rot and
viral infections.<
