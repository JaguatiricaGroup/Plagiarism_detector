Prosecutor Robert McRae said: ``Carcases were left to rot in fields, some were
in a state of decomposition, many of the sheep were suffering but still living,
many of them were on the point of death.<
``The defendant was threatening and abusive and threatened to kill a MAFF
inspector for every sheep they had put down.<
``Many of his animals had been left without treatment, often just allowed to
die.<
``His excuse was that he bought in sheep with existing problems so it was not
his fault, but that was not acceptable.''<
MAFF vet Susan Potter said she had found only one bale of decent forage on the
premises.<
Chris Perry, defending, said Baker had been in the business for 40 years and
bought in sheep not in good shape for about #2.50 each.<
He tried to sell them on to abattoirs at a profit but the amount of food he
had for them was strictly limited.<
