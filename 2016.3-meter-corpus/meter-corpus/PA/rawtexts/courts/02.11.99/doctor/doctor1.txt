GP TRIAL: RELATIVES TELL OF GUILTY FEELINGS<
By Peter Beal, PA News<
The daughter of one of Harold Shipman's alleged victims told his murder trial
today how she came away from an interview with him the day after her mother's
death feeling guilty.<
Pamela Hillier, 68, was found dead in the bedroom of her home in February last
year, an afternoon when Shipman was supposed to have visited her.<
Her daughter Jacqueline Gee told a Preston Crown Court that her mother had
suffered from only mild blood pressure.<
But Shipman told her that Mrs Hillier, of Mottram, near Hyde, Greater
Manchester, had died from a stroke.<
He explained that he could tell the cause of death ``from the way she was
lying''.<
Mrs Gee said that she and her brother had gone to Shipman's surgery the day
after her mother's death to seek an explanation and to come to terms with her
sudden death.<
``We were totally confused,'' said Mrs Gee.<
``I wanted to know that if the doctor seemed to think it was mounting blood
pressure that had caused the stroke why had not increased her dose of tablets.<
``He was going back through the readings and showing us the blood pressure
figures and telling us why he didn't think it was necessary to increase the
dosage.<
``I can remember coming out of the surgery feeling guilty. He was trying to
intimate that mum was poorly and we should have expected that she might have
died at any time.''<
She said Shipman had told them a post mortem examination was unnecessary
because he was sure she had died of a stroke.<
``He said he could tell from the way she was lying. He explained that if she
had had a heart attack she would have been holding her chest or reaching for
something. He said because she was on her back it must have been a sudden thing
and that she had fallen back.''<
Shipman, 53, of Roe Cross Green, Mottram, denies murdering 15 women patients
and forging the #386,000 will of one of them.<
A statement from police computer expert Det Sgt John Ashley which was read to
the jury detailed computer records relating to Mrs Hillier, some of which had
been altered by Shipman on the afternoon of her death - but nearly two hours
before her body was found.<
One of the entries purported to relate to more than a month earlier when he
recorded she had suffered headaches and felt unwell.<
Another, purporting to have been made three days earlier, recorded that her
blood pressure was raised and that he had spoken to her about her diet and
exercise.<
But Mrs Gee said she had no recollection of her mother, who was exceptionally
active, having seen the doctor on that day.<
She said Mrs Hillier had been in good health apart from a knee problem with
which she had been due to see the doctor on the day of her death.<
