FAMILY `UNHAPPY' WITH SHIPMAN'S EXPLANATION FOR DEATH<
By Peter Beal and Chris Marritt, PA News<
The family of one of Harold Shipman's alleged victims told his murder trial
today how they were left ``unhappy and confused'' by the GP's explanation for
her death.<
Pamela Hillier, 68, described as a fit and active grandmother, was found lying
dead in her bedroom in February last year on the same afternoon as Shipman had
paid her a visit.<
The doctor declared that Mrs Hillier had died from a ``massive'' stroke. But
members of her family told Preston Crown Court that she had only been suffering
from slightly high blood pressure.<
Her daughter Jacqueline Gee said she had come away from an interview with
Shipman the day after her mother's death ``feeling guilty''.<
``He was trying to intimate that mum was poorly and we should have expected
that she might die at any time,'' said Mrs Gee.<
Her husband Martin described Shipman as ``unhelpful and uncaring'' when he
spoke to them at Mrs Hillier's home shortly after her death.<
``I will always remember Dr Shipman's words `Let's put it down to a stroke',''
said Mr Gee.<
``Now I realise it was a very imprecise way for a doctor to speak but at the
time I just accepted it.<
``Any sensible question that was raised he didn't answer in any way or explain
in any way what happened.<
``Dr Shipman led us to believe he was expecting this sort of occurrence and
said we should have been expecting this.<
``My wife was asking very sensible questions and to my mind Dr Shipman was
extremely unhelpful and uncaring towards a daughter who had just lost her mother
and as a doctor who had just lost a patient of 12 years.''<
Shipman, 53, of Roe Cross Green, Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester,
pleads not guilty to murdering 15 of his women patients and forging the #386,000
will of one of them. The Crown allege he administered them fatal doses of
morphine.<
Mr Gee said Shipman was trying to paint a picture of someone whose death was
expected.<
``But this wasn't the picture of someone who played cricket with my daughters
and walked the dogs three times a day. She came to our house two or three times
a week and she was always out in the garden in the fresh air. I wasn't aware of
any heart problems at all,'' he said.<
Mrs Gee described her mother as a ``bundle of fun'' who had remained active
since the death of her husband a year earlier. <
In the days before her death she had been stripping wallpaper and moving
furniture before redecorating her house in Stalybridge Road, Mottram.<
On the morning of the day she died she had telephoned Shipman's surgery to ask
for a home visit for treatment to a knee injury she had suffered when stumbling
on a piece of carpet.<
Mrs Gee said she had been in ``absolute and total shock'' when she found her
mother had died. She had been with her that morning and left her perfectly
well.<
Dr Shipman had arrived at the house and came down after seeing her mother's
body in the bedroom.<
``He said my mother had had a stroke. He could tell from the way she was
lying,'' said Mrs Gee. ``He said because she was on her back it must have been a
sudden thing because she had fallen back.''<
Shipman had told her there was no need for a post-mortem examination. She
described the doctor's manner as ``very abrupt''.<
Mrs Hillier's son Keith said that he and his sister Mrs Gee had asked Shipman
about the nature of their mother's stroke at his surgery the following day.<
``He said that it was due to, or that a major cause was, high blood
pressure,'' said Mr Hillier.<
``To be perfectly honest, it was confusing. He said my mum did have high blood
pressure and that it wasn't high enough to give him major concern.<
``But she died from high blood pressure. He just seemed to go round in
circles. I wasn't happy because I was confused as much as anything.''<
Mr Hillier said he had told the doctor he was still confused and that perhaps
the only way to get to the bottom of his mother's death was a post-mortem
examination.<
``It was really to put my mind at ease,'' said Mr Hillier. ``Dr Shipman felt
it was unnecessary and that he had diagnosed the cause of death accurately. He
also pointed out it was an unpleasant thing to have to put my mum through.''<
Mr Hillier said he had agreed ``reluctantly'' to accept Shipman's
recommendation. Mrs Hillier's body was later cremated.<
Mrs Gee said that Shipman had apologised for his manner at the house the
previous evening.<
``He said to me the next day `I apologise for my behaviour, but I was as
shocked as you were'.''<
Mrs Hillier's next door neighbour Peter Elwood said he had found her body at
5.15 in the afternoon of February 9 after Mrs Gee telephoned him when she was
unable to contact her mother.<
Ambulancemen and Mrs Gee arrived at the house, followed shortly afterwards by
Shipman.<
Mr Elwood said he heard one of the ambulance crew say to Shipman: ``I shall
have to notify the police. This is a sudden death at home.''<
Mr Elwood said that Shipman had replied: ``I don't think there's any need for
that.''<
The jury were told that entries on Shipman's computer relating to Mrs Hillier
had not been created on the dates to which they referred.<
An entry dated January 5 in which she was said to have complained of feeling
unwell and another dated February 6 in which Shipman recorded she had raised
blood pressure were both only created on the day of her death - nearly two hours
before her body was found.<
Independent GP Dr John Grenville said that Mrs Hillier suffered only slightly
high blood pressure which was extremely well-controlled.<
He said in the circumstances Shipman's diagnosis of a stroke was not
justified. As a GP Dr Grenville said he would have notified the Coroner in the
expectation that an autopsy would be carried out.<
The trial was adjourned until next Monday.<
