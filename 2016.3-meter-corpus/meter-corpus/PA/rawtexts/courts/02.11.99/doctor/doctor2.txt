Mrs Gee described her mother as a ``bundle of fun'' who would play football with
her two grandchildren, walk her dog and decorate her house.<
Mrs Gee's husband Martin told how he arrived at Mrs Hillier's home shortly
after her death to find his wife and Shipman in conversation.<
He told the jury: ``My wife was extremely upset but she was trying in her own
mind to understand what had happened.<
``Dr Shipman led us to believe he had been expecting this sort of occurrence
and said we should have expected this.<
``My wife was asking very sensible questions and Dr Shipman was extremely
unhelpful and uncaring towards a daughter who had just lost a mother.<
``I will always remember Dr Shipman's words were `put it down as a stroke'.''<
Mr Gee said he realised now it was a very imprecise way for a doctor to speak
but at the time he just accepted it.<
``Any sensible question that was raised he didn't answer and in no way at all
did he explain what had happened.''<
He said they had accepted the doctor's recommendation that a post mortem
examination was unnecessary.<
