Mrs Hillier's next-door neighbour Peter Elwood said he let himself into her
house after receiving a phone call from Mrs Gee who had been unable to contact
her mother.<
He found Mrs Hillier lying at the foot of her bed.<
He said he saw what he thought was a box of tablets on the bed. He went over
to her but could find no pulse and tried unsuccessfully to revive her.<
Mr Elwood said shortly afterwards paramedics arrived, followed by Dr Shipman.<
He said: ``I heard one of the ambulancemen say: `I shall have to notify the
police, this is a sudden death at home'.<
``I heard Dr Shipman say: `I don't think there is any need to do that.'''<
Mr Elwood said that Dr Shipman seemed ``very detached and unfriendly'' towards
Mr and Mrs Gee when he was talking to them about Mrs Hillier's death.<
Mrs Hillier's son Keith said he spoke, with his sister, to Dr Shipman the
following day, when he was told his mother had suffered a massive stroke.<
The doctor had said a major cause or contribution was high blood pressure.<
Mr Hillier said he had always been under the impression that his mother had
high blood pressure but that it was not particularly high.<
He said: ``To be perfectly honest I was confused. He said my mum did have high
blood pressure and that it wasn't high enough to give him major concern but that
she had died from high blood pressure. He just seemed to go round in circles.''<
He added: ``I wasn't happy because I was confused as much as anything.''<
Mr Hillier said he had said to the doctor that perhaps the only way to get to
the bottom of what has caused the death was a post-mortem examination.<
``He felt it was unnecessary. He had diagnosed the cause of death accurately
and he also pointed out it was an unpleasant thing to happen and unpleasant
thing to put mum through.''<
Richard Henriques QC, prosecuting, asked him: ``Did you accept that?''<
Mr Hillier said: ``Reluctantly I did accept that.''<
