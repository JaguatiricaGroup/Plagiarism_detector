Dr John Grenville, a GP called by the prosecution as an expert witness, said Mrs
Hillier had been diagnosed with slightly high blood pressure in 1995 but this
had been extremely well-controlled with a low dosage of medication.<
He said that Mrs Hillier was at no greater risk of suffering a stroke or heart
attack than any other member of the population.<
Mr Henriques asked him if Shipman's diagnosis of a stroke was justified. Dr
Grenville replied: ``No.''<
He said he would have treated it as a sudden and unexpected death in a woman
seen by the doctor earlier that day who had slightly raised blood pressure but
that he would not be able to say what the cause of death was.<
``I would have reported to the coroner in the expectation he would order an
autopsy,'' added Dr Grenville.<
