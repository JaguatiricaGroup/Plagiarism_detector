SOCCER CLUB MANAGER ACCUSED OF CHILD SEX OFFENCES<
By Maria Breslin, PA News <
Southampton FC manager Dave Jones was due to appear before magistrates today
charged with a number of sex offences against children.<
The 43-year-old former Everton defender and father-of-four was arrested in
June when he voluntarily attended Liverpool's Wavertree Road police station.<
He faces nine allegations at Liverpool City Magistrates Court relating to
sexual offences and ill-treatment of children dating back to the 1980s when he
was employed as a care worker at a home in north Merseyside.<
Jones, who lives with his wife and children on an estate in Chilworth, a few
miles outside Southampton, was officially charged when he returned to Liverpool
to answer his bail in September.<
He was arrested in connection with Operation Care _ a long-running
investigation into historic allegations of child abuse at children's homes in
the North West.<
Jones, who was born in Liverpool, made his debut as a player for Everton in
1976 but his career was cut short when a knee injury forced him to retire from
the game.<
He returned to football as assistant manager and coach at Morecambe,
eventually being appointed manager of Stockport County, who under his reign
enjoyed one of their most fruitful spells.<
He moved to Southampton in 1997, and earlier this year helped the team ensure
Premiership survival, beating his old club Everton 2-0 at The Dell in the last
game of the season, to ensure another year in the top flight of English
football.<
