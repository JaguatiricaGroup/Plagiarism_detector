FOOTBALL MANAGER DENIES CHILD ABUSE CHARGES<
By Maria Breslin, PA News<
Southampton Football Club manager Dave Jones today denied 10 charges of child
abuse dating back to the 1980s when he was employed as a care worker in a
children's home.<
The former Everton defender and father-of-four pleaded not guilty to all
counts of indecent assault and child cruelty when he appeared before Liverpool
City Magistrates Court.<
The allegations against the 43-year-old football boss, who lives with his wife
and family in Chilworth, Hants, date from February 1987 to May 1990.<
Jones has been charged with four counts of indecent assault against two boys
aged 16 or under.<
He faces six further counts alleging he assaulted, ill treated, abandoned or
exposed three boys in a manner likely to cause them unnecessary suffering or
injury to health.<
The Southampton manager, wearing a black suit, white shirt and red tie,
listened intently during the 20-minute hearing.<
An order made by stipendiary magistrate Paul Firth preventing the home where
Jones was employed from being identified.<
The defendant was granted bail on condition of residence, not approach
prosecution witnesses or staff past and present from the Merseyside home.<
The case was adjourned until December 13 for committal to Crown Court.<
Reporting restrictions were not lifted.<
Jones was arrested in June this year when he voluntarily attended Liverpool's
Wavertree Road police station.<
He was charged in connection with Operation Care - a long-running
investigation into allegations of child abuse at children's homes in the
region.<
The soccer manager arrived at the court accompanied by family and friends in a
police van.<
He was given an escort by Merseyside officers into the court building.<
A handful of demonstrators wielding anti-Operation Care placards lined the
entrance.<
Jones, who was born in Liverpool, made his debut as a player for Everton in
1976 but his career was cut short by a knee injury.<
He returned to football as assistant manager and coach at Morecambe,
eventually being appointed manager of Stockport County.<
He moved to Southampton in 1997 and earlier this year helped the team ensure
Premiership survival by beating Everton 2-0 at The Dell in the last game of the
season.<
