OSTRICHES' LAST TRIP IN CATTLE TRUCK, COURT HEARS<
By Phil Hazlewood, PA News<
An animal welfare expert today told a court how he discovered a cattle truck
was transporting a cargo of ostriches, two of them injured.<
Birmingham Magistrates' Court was told the routine vehicle check found two of
the 26 birds _ destined for a slaughterhouse _ were covered in blood.<
Lorry driver Adrian Shaw, of Malvern, Worcestershire, and his employer, Edward
Gilder, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, both deny two charges of animal cruelty
under the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Act 1997 and the Animal Health Act
1981.<
The court heard that the lorry was stopped between junctions six and seven of
the northbound M6 at Perry Barr, Birmingham, on February 9, 1998, for a routine
vehicle check.<
An inspection was carried out by Birmingham City Council's senior animal
welfare officer, Graham Taylor, and a colleague, with the help of West Midlands
Police.<
The check found that the 26 birds were being taken from Windsor to a
slaughterhouse in Whitchurch, Shropshire.<
Mr Taylor said: ``I was amazed to see a cattle truck being used to transport
ostriches. When I introduced myself to the driver, I was surprised when he told
me what he had on board.<
``The vehicle was not adapted in any way. One would expect a vehicle
transporting exotic animals to have some sort of adaptation to it given the type
of animals being transported.<
``The partition gates that formed pens in the vehicle were severely damaged,
the sort one would expect to find with continued use and when large animals were
being carried,'' he told the court.<
Mr Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said that the birds _ all 12 to 14-month-old
mature yearlings _ were at risk because of ``sharp protrusions'' on the
partition gates dividing the pens.<
Ventilation holes in the lorry were also not covered as prescribed by law,
which meant that the birds could poke their heads out, Mr Berlin said.<
The two injured birds suffered injuries to their heads and necks as a result
of cracks and sharp edges on the 2ft 6in gates, the court was told.<
Mr Taylor said that when he inspected the vehicle the gates were covered in
blood.<
``I would have thought to transport using damaged partitions was very unwise.
Ostriches behave in an inquiring way with their necks which, because of the
height of the gates, were just the right height for the injuries they had.<
``They rub their necks along them from side to side. I suggested (to Mr Shaw)
that full head gates might be more suitable but I particularly said to him that
the edge of the partition needed repair,'' Mr Taylor said.<
``I would have thought that the ventilation apertures would be covered with
some form of mesh to make sure that the birds did not push their heads through
when they were being loaded, unloaded and during the journey.''<
After inspecting the lorry, Shaw was allowed to continue his journey to
Shropshire as it was deemed too impractical to unload the animals on to another
vehicle for such a short journey, Mr Taylor said.<
The defence said that the birds were injured as a result of ``inter-ostrich
activity''.<
Head injuries on the birds were said to be ``classically indicative'' of being
inadvertently trodden on by another bird, they said.<
