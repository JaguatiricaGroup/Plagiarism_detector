Defence counsel Judith Kenney challenged Mr Taylor on the thoroughness of his
one-hour inspection of the vehicle.<
The animal welfare officer had, she said, put ``two and two together'' to
ascertain the cause of the birds' injuries without actually checking inside the
lorry and the partitions.<
``Your evidence is clearly based on three injuries occurring to two birds on
the edge of a partition that you never ran your finger across and never
examined,'' she told Mr Taylor.<
``It (Taylor's evidence) is based only on photographs. But photographs don't
always tell the whole story, do they?'' Ms Kenney said.<
``There's not necessarily a need to touch something to tell whether it is
sharp or not,'' Mr Taylor replied.<
Mr Taylor said he had carried out the inspection in accordance with guidelines
set out by the Meat Hygiene Service, a department of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<
He had not called a vet to inspect the animals before they were killed a week
later and no post mortem examination was arranged.<
``I didn't feel it was necessary because of the guidance that I had been given
by the Government which did not require me to obtain that evidence at the
time,'' he said.<
Nor did the accused, Mr Shaw, inspect the partition gates on the 10-year-old
articulated truck, even though he had been given the opportunity to do so, Mr
Taylor said.<
``If it was me, I would be up and down ladders trying to sort something out,
making arrangements and even bringing the truck back for me to look at,'' Mr
Taylor said.<
He said he had not seen anything like it in his 22 years of law enforcement
and 10 years working in the livestock industry.<
``What I saw totally amazed me. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. If I
saw the same thing again I would see it as equally bizarre to find a vehicle
like this transporting ostriches,'' he said.<
The case was adjourned to a date to be fixed.<
