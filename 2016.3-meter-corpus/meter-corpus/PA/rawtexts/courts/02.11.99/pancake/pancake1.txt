FACTORY WORKER `PUT GLASS IN PANCAKES'<
By Mark Woods, PA News<
A disgruntled worker contaminated thousands of savoury pancakes with glass
after he was told he was to be made redundant, a court heard today.<
John McKay, from Wark, Northumberland, poured 19 handfuls of glass into diced
onions over five weekends before they were added to the snacks at the Findus
factory in Longbenton, Newcastle upon Tyne, the jury at Newcastle Crown Court
was told.<
A massive recall operation was launched in February 1998 after customers
suffered cuts to their mouths and broken teeth after biting into the sharp cubes
of glass.<
Paul Sloan, prosecuting, told the court that the 61-year-old, who denies five
charges of contaminating goods between December 1997 and February 1998, was
heard singing ``Findus pancakes are class, because they are full of glass'' by
colleagues at the Nestle-owned plant which employs 800 workers.<
The contamination and resulting recall of millions of pancakes lost the firm
an estimated #3.5 million, the court heard.<
In November 1997 the company informed workers that the weekend night shift, on
which McKay worked, was to be scrapped.<
Although the defendant avoided losing his job, a second round of job losses
was soon announced and McKay was told he was ``third on the list'' in the
last-in first-out policy that was adopted, as he had only worked at the plant
for five years.<
Mr Sloan told the court: ``The defendant was heard by colleagues saying he was
unhappy with his redundancy. He said `what kind of job will I get at my age'.<
``He was also seen with cuts to his fingers and told colleagues he had cut
himself clearing a greenhouse, an explanation he later denied giving.<
``On the weekend of January 10 and 11, the defendant was heard to say `if
someone wanted to get back at the company it would be easy, because the
machinery does not detect glass'.<
``At this stage no complaint had been received about any contamination. On the
weekend of January 24 and 25, he was seen loitering around the chilled store
area where the produce is kept before being used, for about 15 minutes.<
``The following weekend the defendant was off sick and no pancakes were
contaminated. All the other workers facing redundancy were at work that
weekend.''<
