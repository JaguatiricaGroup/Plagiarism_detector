  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Sloan told the jury that after the first complaints were received on Friday
February 13, the glass from within the factory or from suppliers was checked and
ruled out as being the source of the problem.<
He added that after more than 5,500 cubes of glass had been returned from
customers they were tested and shown to be from the same source, a vehicle's
side window.<
The contaminated batches, which affected beef and onion, chicken and mushroom
and chicken and bacon flavoured pancakes, were then traced to the weekend shift.
McKay was arrested on February 21.<
Mr Sloan added: ``After the first complaints were received rumours started to
circulate around the plant over the weekend of February 14 and 15.<
``The accused was heard to sing a little ditty `Findus crispy pancakes are
class, because they are full of glass,' which he later denied.<
``The defendant had a motive for committing the offences and he had the
opportunity.<
``Of course he was not the only person with the motive or opportunity, but
when you consider all that he did and said over the period in question, you can
only draw one conclusion, that he was responsible for introducing the glass.''<
