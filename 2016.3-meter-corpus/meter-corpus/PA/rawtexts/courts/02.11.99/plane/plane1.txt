FATHER RELIVES SON'S LAST MOMENTS AT MODEL AIRCRAFT DISPLAY<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
An 11-year-old boy was killed when a model aeroplane veered out of control and
ploughed into a crowd of people, an inquest heard today.<
The plane struck Adam Kirby, from Watford, Herts, on the back of his head,
killing him almost instantly, as he watched a man working on a model.<
Graham Reid, who was flying the plane at the time, said he had shouted out
when he realised he had lost control, but his voice was drowned in the noise of
the engine.<
Adam's father, Alan Kirby, told a jury at St Albans Coroner's Court how he had
taken his son to the Phoenix Model Flying Club in Colney Heath, Herts, on March
14 this year.<
Mr Kirby was on the verge of tears as he told how his son was excited at the
prospect of flying at the club for the first time.<
But as they stood in a crowd watching a man trying to start his model aircraft
in the pit area, Mr Reid's plane flew into the crowd and struck several people
on the leg before hitting Adam.<
Mr Reid, a former chief flying instructor at the club, said he had lost
control of his model plane within seconds of it taking off.<
He said: ``I recognised that the aeroplane wasn't responding to my transmitter
and immediately shouted warnings.<
``Within probably 20 seconds the aeroplane had turned 270 degrees by itself
and ended up crashing into the front end of the pits.<
``I was made aware that it was a serious crash and I went into shock. After
that I don't know what happened.''<
Emergency services were called by club members using mobile phones, but they
were unable to save Adam.<
Eyewitness Brian White said of the scene: ``It was dreadful, tragic.''<
The inquest also heard of flaws in the club's ``reverse peg'' system, which
monitored who was using which radio frequency to fly their plane.<
All users were supposed to mark their frequency using a clothes peg labelled
with their name and the frequency, but the inquest heard that on the day, Mr
Reid and another flyer, Timothy Jenkinson, were both using frequency 67 with
unmarked pegs.<
Both men told the inquest they had taken precautions to make sure that their
planes were not both in the sky at the same time.<
Mr Jenkinson said when questioned that he had switched off his radio
transmitter before Mr Reid began the fatal flight.<
