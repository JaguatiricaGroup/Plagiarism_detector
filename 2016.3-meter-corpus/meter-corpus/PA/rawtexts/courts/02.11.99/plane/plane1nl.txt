ACCIDENT VERDICT ON BOY KILLED BY 50mph STRAY MODEL AIRCRAFT<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
An 11-year-old boy was killed after being struck by a stray model aircraft
when his father took him to a flying club for the first time, an inquest heard
today.<
Adam Kirby, of Watford, Herts, died after the model plane veered out of
control, plunged into a crowd of people at about 50mph and struck him a fatal
blow to the head.<
The accident happened at the Phoenix Model Flying Club, in Colney Heath,
Herts.<
Pilot Graham Reid said he had lost control of the Loaded Dice aircraft just
after it had taken off.<
He said: ``I recognised that the aeroplane wasn't responding to my transmitter
and immediately shouted warnings.<
``Within probably 20 seconds the aeroplane had turned 270 degrees by itself
and ended up crashing into the front end of the pits.<
``I was made aware that it was a serious crash and I went into shock. After
that I don't know what happened.''<
Emergency services were called by club members using mobile phones, but the
inquest at St Albans Magistrates' Court heard that Adam died instantaneously
from a severe head injury.<
Adam's father, Alan Kirby, was close to tears as he told the hearing how Adam
had been excited at the prospect of flying model planes.<
The boy was due to make his first attempt to fly a model aircraft that day _
March 14.<
Mr Kirby said he and his son had been watching a man trying to start a model
plane in the pit area when Mr Reid's plane suddenly crashed into the crowd.<
He said: ``The only thing I felt was when it hit Adam on the back of the
head.<
``Then I think I held him until the police came.''<
Mr Reid shouted he had lost control but his cries were drowned out by engine
noise from the pit area, the inquest heard.<
Squadron Leader Michael Goldby, of the British Model Flying Association, said
the loss of control was probably caused by interference from another transmitter
set to the same frequency.<
The inquest heard that there were flaws in the ``reverse peg'' system used by
the club to stop more than one pilot using the same frequency at the same time.<
Members were supposed to use pegs marked with their name and the frequency,
but in fact Mr Reid and another flyer, Timothy Jenkinson, had both flown on
frequency 67 and used unmarked pegs.<
The inquest also heard from a 15-year boy who said he had also used frequency
67 after asking a club official if it was safe to do so.<
Investigations by the Air Accident Investigation Branch concluded that
although Mr Jenkinson's transmitter had almost certainly not interfered with Mr
Reid's plane, the 15-year-old boy's transmitter could have done.<
West Hertfordshire coroner Edward Thomas directed the jury to return a verdict
of accidental death.<
He added that he would be writing to the Civil Aviation Authority and the
Phoenix Model Flying Club on the matter.<
Mr Thomas said: ``What comes out is that it is very important that all flying
clubs particularly observe the rules and recommendations of the British Model
Flying Association.<
``This is a dreadful tragedy and it is important that no family must have to
suffer anything like it and anything to prevent future fatalities must be
attempted.''<
Speaking on behalf of the family, Ian Cashmore said: ``The verdict is not a
surprise. The coroner had no option, but it does not mean that what happened to
Adam on that day was actually an accident.''<
He said the family was considering the possibility of taking further legal
action.<
