INQUEST HEARS OF RICKY'S LAST NIGHT OUT<
By Martha Linden, PA News<
Asian student Ricky Reel had been part of a group which had consumed a ``good
deal'' of drink on the night he disappeared, an inquest heard today.<
The inquest heard that 10 bottles of beer, a half bottle of whisky and a
bottle of Bacardi were bought on the night the 20-year-old and his three friends
went out in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London.<
A friend of Ricky's, who was named only as Dave for security reasons, said the
group had been ``merry'' after drinking in the car before heading to a Kingston
nightclub.<
Ricky later disappeared after they had been racially abused and attacked by
two white youths in the town centre, but Dave said he was not asked by police at
the time to help provide an E-fit of the attackers.<
John Bevan QC, representing the police, said to Dave: ``The fact is that until
the implications of Ricky going missing became clear, as it dawned the next
morning that he had not returned home, that it was simply the four of you going
out with a good deal to drink, clubbing, to have a thoroughly nice time.''<
It had earlier emerged that Dave had given a statement to the police on
October 22, 1997, the day after Ricky's body was found in the Thames, that they
had been involved in a ``minor scuffle'' with two white men in the town centre
in which two members of the Asian group had been punched.<
Dave said: ``We did not think much of it, otherwise, if we had known that
Ricky was in some sort of danger, we would have gone to the police. But on the
night in question we thought these things happen when you go out and we did not
make much of it.''<
It emerged later under questioning from Mr Bevan that Dave had said in a
police statement in December 1997 he had been ``99% certain'' that the two
racist attackers had escaped the scene by jumping on a bus.<
The inquest at Fulham Town Hall heard earlier that the police had not asked
Dave if he could identify the attackers in a statement he gave to the police in
which he described them on the day after Ricky was reported missing.<
Dave added that he had not been asked, in the first week in which Ricky had
disappeared, if he could help compile an E-fit, a ``body map'' of the
attackers.<
Asked by Michael Mansfield QC, on behalf of the Reel family, if he might have
been able to identify the men at that time, Dave said: ``Closer to the time in
the week after or nearer the time I might have been able to recognise them.'' <
The inquest was shown a still from CCTV camera footage showing two men in
Kingston town centre in the early hours of October 15, 1997.<
Mr Mansfield said expert assessment for the police had shown these men to be
5ft 7in to 5ft 10in.<
In his description of the attackers, Dave had said both the attackers were in
their 20s. He said one was aged between 22 and 25 and was between 5ft 8in and
5ft 9in and of slim build. The other was a short and stocky man in his 20s with
a shaved head.<
:: Police originally claimed Ricky had drowned accidentally while urinating
into the River Thames, but three officers were later found guilty of neglect of
duty in the investigation into his death.<
Earlier this year, the Police Complaints Authority apologised to the Reel
family for ``weaknesses and flaws'' in the investigation.<
The case was reopened and a fresh appeal for information was launched in
August by Ricky's mother Sukhdev and the Metropolitan Police.<
