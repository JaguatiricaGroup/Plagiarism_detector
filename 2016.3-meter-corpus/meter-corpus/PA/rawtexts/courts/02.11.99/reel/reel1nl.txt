RICKY FRIEND CALLED ATTACK `MINOR SCUFFLE'<
By Martha Linden, PA News<
The racial attack on Ricky Reel and his friends on the night he disappeared
was described as a ``minor scuffle'' in a statement by one of the group shortly
after his body was discovered, an inquest heard today.<
A witness named only as Dave for security reasons, who was with Ricky and two
other Asian friends the night he went missing, said the group had dismissed the
attack as something commonplace. <
He told the inquest: ``On the night in question we did not think much of it.
If we had known that Ricky was in some sort of danger we would have gone to the
police but on the night in question we thought these things happen, when you go
out and we did not make much of it.''<
He was speaking on the second day of the inquest at Fulham Town Hall into the
death of the 20-year-old Asian student who was found drowned in the River Thames
on October 21, 1997.<
John Bevan, QC, representing the Metropolitan Police, said that in a separate
statement made in December to officers, Dave had said he was ``99% certain''
that the two white youths involved in the attack - in which they had punched two
of the group of Asian friends and racially abused them - had made their escape
on a bus shortly afterwards.<
Ten bottles of beer, a bottle of Bacardi and a half bottle of whisky were
bought by Ricky's friends on the night he disappeared.<
The friends were ``merry'' when they left their car parked in Kingston upon
Thames, south west London, before setting off through the town centre to visit a
nightclub. <
It was not disclosed how much Ricky, who was known as a moderate drinker, had
consumed.<
The inquest was shown CCTV camera footage of Ricky's last recorded moments in
the early hours of October 15, 1997 where he was seen walking on his own in the
centre of Kingston.<
Dave told the jury that the police had not asked him if he could identify the
two white attackers in the week after Ricky disappeared.<
He said: ``Close to the time in a week after or near the time I might have
been able to recognise them.''<
Sergeant Richard de la Pole, a police diver with nine years experience on the
River Thames, found the student's body face down in a couple of feet of water.<
He said he discovered Ricky's body close to where his friends had parked their
car on the night of the disappearance.<
Police originally claimed the youngster had drowned accidentally while
urinating into the river but three officers were later disciplined over the
first inquiry into his death.<
Earlier this year the Police Complaints Authority found the officers guilty of
neglect of duty and apologised to the Reel family for ``weaknesses and flaws''
in the investigation.<
Ricky's case was subsequently reopened with a fresh appeal for information
launched by his mother Sukhdev and the Metropolitan Police.<
His mother told the inquiry yesterday that she believed Ricky, who had a
phobia of water, had been taken to the river against his will.<
The inquest was adjourned until tomorrow. The jury are due to visit the area
where Ricky disappeared tomorrow afternoon.<
