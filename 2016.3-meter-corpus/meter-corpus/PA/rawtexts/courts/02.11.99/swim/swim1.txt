CORONER URGES SAFETY RETHINK AFTER CHANNEL SWIMMER DROWNS<
By Jo Willey, PA News<
A coroner today called for the Channel Swimmers Association to reconsider the
need for resuscitation equipment on board boats after the death of a Mexican
woman during a Channel swim.<
Fausta Moreno, 41, drowned on August 20 after setting off from Dover's
Shakespeare beach.<
She was said to have been in good health before the swim, but complained of
being uncomfortable after about four-and-a-half hours.<
Miss Moreno was accompanied by the boat Mary Mayne and her crew, which
included the vice chairman of the CSA, Norman Trusty, who was official
scrutineer on the swim.<
Dover coroner Richard Sturt recorded a verdict of accidental death at the
inquest, held at Dover Magistrates Court.<
He said: ``I have had over the years experience of various Channel swims not
just the ones that have gone wrong. I don't think anyone would wish to deter
people from undertaking this rather hazardous adventure.<
``I am glad to hear from the CSA of the careful steps they do take to vet the
suitability of the swimmers and check them as they go along.<
``I don't feel myself qualified to make any comment on resuscitation
equipment, but I will nevertheless hope that the CSA will reconsider the issue
of what equipment they have on boats.<
``At least give further consideration to the question of resuscitation
equipment and a trained person to use it. I fully appreciate what this would add
in terms of expense. <
``From my point of view this forms itself into a very plain and
straightforward case of death by drowning and I record a verdict of accidental
death.''<
Mr Sturt paid tribute to the crew who tried to resuscitate Miss Moreno, saying
they reacted as soon as they realised ``a crisis was in their hands''.<
