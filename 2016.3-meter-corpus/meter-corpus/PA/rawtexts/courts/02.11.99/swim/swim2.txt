  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The inquest heard that Miss Mareno was given advice from the boat when she
started to feel uncomfortable, but appeared to recover after a while and
continued to swim.<
Duncan Taylor, captain of the Mary Mayne, said she began to swim around the
boat following a refreshment break.<
``She wasn't attempting to continue with the swim. She indicated to her coach
she was suffering some discomfort through not being able to pass urine.<
``During this time she had been communicating with us and answering us but
then stopped answering us.<
``We are led by the swimmer and at that time there was no cause for concern.<
``Having started swimming again she stopped again quite soon and complained
again of discomfort, indicating it was much more severe this time.<
``She swam round the stern of the boat and took up position swimming around
aimlessly. I did notice that when she exhaled she would make a slight groaning
noise as if she was crying,'' Mr Taylor added.<
The ship's crew began to grow anxious and, as they decided to abort the swim,
Miss Mareno was dragged out of the water unconscious.<
Despite prolonged attempts to resuscitate her she was pronounced dead at
Buckland Hospital after being taken to shore by the coastguard.<
Dr Anthony Laden, who carried out post-mortem examination, said Miss Mareno's
lungs were almost triple the weight they should have been for someone of her
size.<
Miss Mareno was a slight 4ft 10in tall and weighed only 50kg.<
His findings showed her death was consistent with drowning.<
He added: ``I'm not a resuscitation expert. I can only guess, but I suspect it
may not have made any difference whether there was any resuscitation equipment
on board.''<
