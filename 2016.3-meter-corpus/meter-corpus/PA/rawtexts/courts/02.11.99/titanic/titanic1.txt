TITANIC RESTAURANT CASE DISCONTINUED<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
Celebrity chef Marco Pierre White today won the battle of the Titanic and
Atlantic restaurants.<
Oliver Peyton, owner of the Atlantic Bar and Grill, had tried to sink Marco's
new Titanic restaurant housed in the same West End hotel in London by seeking
damages against landlords Forte Hotels and an injunction in the High Court.<
But today the Atlantic announced in court it had reached a confidential
agreement with the landlords and was discontinuing the whole action.<
Mr Justice Rattee ordered that the Titanic should receive higher rate
indemnity costs with a #200,000 interim payment.<
Charles Purle QC, representing the Titanic, said they had spent more than
#250,000 defending the action.<
The total legal costs of the abandoned claim, estimated at more than #500,000,
will be paid by Forte Hotels under the terms of the settlement with Mr Peyton.<
A joint statement issued by the Atlantic and their landlords after the
settlement read: ``Atlantic Bar and Grill and Forte Hotel Group confirm that any
disputes which may have existed between the two parties are now settled and they
look forward to resuming a good relationship long into the future.''<
Mr Peyton, whose action began on Monday, had claimed that the Titanic was a
replica of the Atlantic, with the same art deco style and attracting the same
clientele and should not be allowed to trade in competition because he has
exclusive rights under his lease at the Regent Palace Hotel off Piccadilly
Circus.<
