                 13:15 02/11/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Titanic
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas Dowding QC, representing the Atlantic, had claimed that a covenant in
Mr Peyton's lease - under which he was paying #480,000 a year rent - barred his
landlords from allowing a competing business in the same building, with a
proviso that nothing should prevent the landlords from carrying on their trade
as hoteliers, restaurateurs and caterers.<
Mr Justice Rattee said on Monday that the covenant and proviso appeared
contradictory and meaningless because the landlords were promising not to
compete but retaining the right to do so.<
The hearing was set to continue for two weeks but this morning the judge was
told that it was being abandoned.<
Mr Dowding said Atlantic had reached agreement with Forte and no longer wished
to pursue an injunction forbidding the Titanic from trading.<
Mr Purle told the judge today: ``Marco Pierre White has had to put up with
these proceedings while his business is in its infancy. Lesser individuals might
have crumbled at the outset.''<
He said it was right that someone whose business has been put under threat
should receive indemnity costs.<
The judge said he was ``concerned by the way the litigation had been
conducted'' by Atlantic and this did justify an award of indemnity costs rather
than standard costs.<
He refused leave to appeal against the costs order.<
