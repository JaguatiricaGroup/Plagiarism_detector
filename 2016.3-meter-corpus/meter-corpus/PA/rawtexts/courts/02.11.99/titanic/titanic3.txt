Marco Pierre White, who was not in court, said of today's hearing: ``It went
very well. But it would have saved a lot of aggravation and time if Oliver had
applied a little more intelligence.''<
He said he was never worried about the threat hanging over him because his
hobbies were ``hunting, fishing and litigation''.<
``I am a hunter by nature,'' he said.<
``I am disappointed that it did not continue. I wanted to see him (Peyton) in
the witness box.''<
His lawyer, Keith Schilling, said the Titanic was not a party to the
settlement between Atlantic and Forte.<
