PGA CHIEFS `LIKED TO SEE WOMEN IN SKIRTS', TRIBUNAL TOLD<
By Matthew Cooper, PA News<
A Professional Golfers' Association manager who quit her job after being asked
not to wear trousers today insisted she was told the organisation's chief
executive and executive secretary ``liked to see their women in skirts''.<
Judy Owen, who claims the PGA's request to wear a skirt amounted to sexual
discrimination, told an employment tribunal that Gerry Paton, the PGA's director
of training, grinned as he made the comment.<
Under cross-examination by the PGA's counsel, Jenny Eady, Mrs Owen denied she
was mistaken in attributing the remark to Mr Paton or that she had
``exaggerated'' her account of the conversation.<
Mrs Owen, who spent just three weeks in her #28,000-a-year post as training
manager before being signed off sick by her doctor, claimed Mr Paton told her
the PGA chief executive Sandy Jones and executive secretary David Wright
``probably just liked to see their women in skirts''.<
The 39-year-old also alleged that she was physically sick in the minutes after
Mr Paton told her her trouser suit was not ``traditional'' enough for the PGA's
``conservative requirements''.<
Mrs Eady said: ``I am going to say that Mr Paton never made any remarks about
Mr Jones or Mr Wright preferring to see women in short skirts.''<
Mrs Owen replied: ``I am very, very certain that the conversation happened.''<
Pressed by Miss Eady that she had ``exaggerated'' her account and that there
was ``no suggestion that Mr Jones wanted to see women in skirts'', the witness
insisted: ``I am very clear about what was said.''<
Mrs Owen, of Meriden, Solihull, West Midlands, told the hearing: ``Gerry Paton
made a comment jokingly that Sandy Jones and David Wright probably just liked to
see their women in skirts.<
``I commented that some skirts could be seen as inappropriate business dress -
possibly if they were too short. Gerry Paton grinned and said `They'd probably
like that more'. I was not happy with this conversation.''<
She also told the second day of the Birmingham hearing that ``the mechanics of
walking around in a skirt'' meant she had to be more careful in how she
``conducted herself'' at work.<
Mrs Owen acknowledged that an ``open staircase'' at the PGA's headquarters at
The Belfry, Warwickshire, which she cited yesterday as a particular problem, did
not have slats and was ``glass-sided''.<
The former cabin crew training manager with British Airways was first
confronted about the dress code on April 15 last year, her second day in her new
job.<
She alleged that she was told by Mr Paton's secretary that ``ladies don't wear
trousers at the PGA.''<
The row came to a head on May 5 1998 when Mr Paton allegedly ordered her ``not
to play games'' and to go home to change into a skirt or dress.<
The applicant, who wrote a letter of resignation on May 28, claimed her
experiences at the PGA damaged her self-esteem and left her feeling incompetent
and humiliated.<
The PGA argued that Mrs Owen was not sent home to change and maintained that
its dress code was not discriminatory.<
