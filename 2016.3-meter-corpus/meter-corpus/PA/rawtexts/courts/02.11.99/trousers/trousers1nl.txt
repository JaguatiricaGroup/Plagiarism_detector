PGA WOMAN WAS `IRRATIONAL' OVER DRESS REQUEST<
By Matthew Cooper, PA News<
The chief executive of the Professional Golfers' Association today claimed a
woman employee who resigned after being told not to wear trousers had failed to
react rationally to the request.<
Sandy Jones, who has headed the PGA since 1991, told an employment tribunal
that he would have expected Judy Owen to have shown more maturity after she was
told to wear a skirt or dress to work.<
Mr Jones, of Four Oaks, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, told the Birmingham
hearing that golf was a ``very traditional'' sport and defended the ban on women
employees wearing trousers as something the PGA's 6,500-strong membership would
expect.<
Mrs Owen, 39, of Meriden, Solihull, West Midlands, claims the order not to
wear trousers and alleged ``bullying and harassment'' at the PGA headquarters at
The Belfry, Warwickshire, amounted to sex discrimination.<
Mr Jones told the hearing: ``I hold a certain view on what I regard to be
appropriate dress for all employees of the PGA whilst they are at national
headquarters.<
``I took the view in the early part of my tenure in the job that the members,
to whom I was accountable, expected employees to be smartly and conservatively
dressed.<
``This applied equally to men and women. In my view this entailed the men
wearing shirt and tie with a suit jacket or blazer and the women wearing skirts
or dresses.''<
The head of the PGA said he was unaware Mrs Owen - who resigned after just
three weeks in her #28,000-a-year job as a training manager - had any concerns
about the dress code until he received her letter of resignation.<
Mr Jones, who said he had an entirely ``open mind'' about what could be
considered conventional or appropriate attire, added that the dress code had
never been formalised because it was ``not an issue''.<
The 52-year-old added: ``To assert that the policy was of itself
discriminatory is not correct. Judy came very quickly to unwarranted conclusions
about the PGA. My own view is that Judy's reaction was not considered or
rational.<
``Common sense should have been allowed to prevail and I would have expected
far more maturity in trying to deal with these issues.''<
Mr Jones said the PGA's director of training, Gerry Paton - who is alleged to
have ordered Mrs Owen to go home and change into a skirt - was not a sexist.<
``I do not believe that Gerry was a sexist or treated Judy in any way
detrimentally because she is a woman,'' Mr Jones told the hearing.<
``Judy is an articulate, intelligent and forceful person. I can only assume
that when she perceived things to be going wrong with Gerry in the early part of
her employment with us she looked for reasons why and concluded it must be
because she was a woman,'' he added.<
Earlier, Mrs Owen insisted Mr Paton told her that Mr Jones and the PGA's
executive secretary ``liked to see their women in skirts''.<
She said Mr Paton grinned as he made the comment.<
Under cross-examination by the PGA's counsel, Jenny Eady, Mrs Owen denied she
was mistaken in attributing the remark to Mr Paton or that she had
``exaggerated'' her account of the conversation.<
She claimed Mr Paton told her that Mr Jones and executive secretary David
Wright ``probably just liked to see their women in skirts''.<
The former cabin crew training manager with British Airways was first
confronted about the dress code on April 15 last year, her second day in her new
job.<
The row came to a head on May 5 1998 when Mr Paton allegedly ordered her ``not
to play games'' and to go home to change into a skirt or dress.<
Mrs Owen, who wrote a letter of resignation on May 28, claims her experiences
at the PGA damaged her self-esteem and left her feeling incompetent and
humiliated.<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
