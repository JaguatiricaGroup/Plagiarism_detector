REFUGEES WENT ON MULTI-MILLION CRIME SPREE<
By Melvyn Howe, PA News<
A couple of Vietnamese refugees given a new life in Britain embarked on a
multi-million pound crime spree while posing as poor benefit claimants, a court
heard today.<
The former boat people, apparently destitute when they arrived from one of the
Hong Kong holding camps, first embarked on a series of shoplifting expeditions
at leading department stores.<
Not content with that, Thanh Tuan Le, 42, and his 38-year-old wife Tam Nguyen,
later joined an international fake Rolex scam, while regularly pocketing
hundreds of pounds a month in Income Support and housing benefit handouts.<
Fifteen of the watches, along with large amounts of diamond-studded jewellery
and solid gold cups, saucers, bowls and coffee pots were later found in safety
deposit boxes in Harrods and Selfridges, London's Middlesex Guildhall Crown
Court was told.<
It all pointed to a lavish lifestyle for the couple who only ever travelled
first class during their regular trips abroad.<
Their Housing Association home in Ryan Close, Ferrier Estate, Kidbrooke, south
east London, bristled with security devices to protect some of the stolen
property they kept there, as well as an array of electronic luxuries. <
The latter included a #29,000 top-of-the-range hi-fi in the living room.<
James Dennison, prosecuting, told the court surprised police also found two
remote-controlled lavatories.<
These, part of bathroom suites costing thousands of pounds, washed and
blow-dried users at the touch of a button.<
A three-bedroomed #89,000 semi-detached home in the next road, and a #23,500
Mercedes with personalised number plates - both bought for cash - provided
additional gloss.<
So far police have identified total benefit of #3.2m, of which #1.66m is in
the form of realisable assets.<
In addition officers who spent two and a half years investigating the couple
and traced bank accounts in Britain, Hong Kong and Vietnam, believe more than
#1m may have been invested in Australia, with further substantial funds in
Japan.<
The couple, who admitted one count of conspiracy to handle #158,395 of stolen
property, are expected to be sentenced tomorrow.<
