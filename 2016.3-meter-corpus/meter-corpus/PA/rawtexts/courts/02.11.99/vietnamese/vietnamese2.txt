Opening the case Mr Dennison explained that despite the value of the property
involved in the charge, the two defendants accepted that a much larger quantity
of items ``not demonstrably stolen had been obtained by them through a course of
criminal conduct.''<
He told the court the couple's life of dishonesty finally came to an end after
they drove up to Knightsbridge in London in their Mercedes and parked it outside
Harrods for what was to prove to be their last shoplifting expedition.<
Harrods security staff spotted them stealing items and then followed the pair
as they targeted other stores nearby.<
After being detained Nguyen was spotted as she tried to throw away a key. It
was retrieved and later found to belong to a Harrods safety deposit box.<
She and her husband were subsequently jailed for two and a half years for
theft.<
But Mr Dennison said a separate investigation which followed uncovered a web
of dishonesty that circled the globe. <
Amongst other things, it was discovered that the glittering array of largely
Cartier jewellery worth more than #43,000 which Nguyen was wearing when she was
arrested, had been stolen in Switzerland and Japan during the previous four
years.<
When the Harrods deposit box was opened police found a ``higgledy piggledy''
pile of watches and diamond-encrusted jewellery worth an estimated #1m. <
One of the items, a gold necklace, was alone valued at #47,000. <
As the investigation continued two safety deposit boxes in Selfridges were
also opened.<
This yielded further incriminating evidence including another valuable haul of
jewellery and watches.<
Amongst them were various watch dials, plates and other items stolen from
Rolex's factory in Switzerland.<
A search of their home uncovered a precision drill which subsequent analysis
showed had been used to drill into gold, silver and other precious metals. ``It
is the Crown's contention that these defendants received the various goods from
Switzerland and Japan through a network of friends and associates,'' said Mr
Dennison.<
``They also both made a large number of trips to the Continent, Far East and
Middle East and on any one of those could have received items.''<
The prosecution also maintained that the stolen Rolexes and watch parts
``could have been used by someone with the appropriate mechanical skills to make
up different dials and thereby alter a watch, either to hide its identity or
give it an inflated value''. <
A number of the timepieces were found to have been tampered with in this way.
<
He added the couple had a string of previous convictions for dishonesty in
both Hong Kong and Britain after fleeing Vietnam in the early eighties.<
