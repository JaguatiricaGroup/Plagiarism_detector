ISLAND LAUNCHES COURT BID FOR MORE FUNDING<
By John Aston, PA News<
The Isle of Wight today launched a High Court battle for ``a fair share'' of
British and European grant funding.<
Islanders are accusing the Government of blocking them access to many millions
of pounds in regional aid and subsidies which would make a significant
contribution to regenerating their ailing economy.<
Today a judge sitting in London gave the Isle of Wight Council permission to
seek a declaration that the Government is breaching European Community law by
not recommending it for ``Tier 2'' regional funding.<
The council will also seek a declaration that a Government decision not to
propose the island for the ``Objective 2'' EU aid category was the result of a
failure to properly consider the special difficulties of being an island.<
Although only five miles from the mainland, the Isle of Wight lacks the
prosperity of south-east England and its 6.4% unemployment rate in October was
more than double the south-east rate.<
Giving permission for a judicial review application to go ahead, Mr Justice
Owen said the case was urgent and should come on for a full hearing before the
end of December.<
He said the system of aid under attack was due to come into force on January 1
2000 - ``if ever there was a case where expedition was necessary it is this
case''.<
Later the judge's decision was welcomed by Councillor Harry Rees, deputy
leader of the council, who said the decisions not to grant the island Objective
2 and Assisted Area monies flew in the face of the Amsterdam Treaty, which
specifically recognised that EU islands suffered economic and social handicaps
by being separated from the mainland.<
Councillor Rees said there was already anger and dismay over a recent decision
to exclude the island from those parts of the country given Objective One ``top
tier'' assisted area status, which was now being investigated by the European
ombudsman.<
At the end of the year the island would lose its Intermediate Assisted Area
Status (IAAS) and have to settle for the much lower Enterprise status, where
grants were greatly restricted.<
Between 1993 and 1998 its IAAS designation had led to grants of #5 million
being offered to 65 companies operating on the island, creating or safeguarding
over 1100 jobs.<
Councillor Rees said it was likely that the European Court of Justice would
eventually have to make a ruling on the issues raised, which could affect many
other islands within the EU.<
He accused successive governments of overlooking the needs of the Isle of
Wight, which had a gross domestic product per head which averaged 75% of the EU
average - the level normally entitling a region to access substantial Community
funds.<
The reality had been distorted because statistics were calculated by putting
the island together with wealthier neighbour Hampshire, when the crucial figure
rose to 99%.<
