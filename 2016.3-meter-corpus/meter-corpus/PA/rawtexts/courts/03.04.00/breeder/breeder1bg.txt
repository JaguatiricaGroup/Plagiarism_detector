POLICE TRY TO UNRAVEL KILLER'S 16 MISSING YEARS<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
Detectives were tonight trying to establish whether double killer Kevin
Cotterell could be linked to any other murders or sex crimes during the past two
decades.<
A psychological profiler who examined the case found it hard to believe that
Cotterell could go in one step from committing two house burglaries in 1983 to
carrying out two bizarre and brutal murders 16 years later.<
Officers investigating murders in Cambridgeshire and Devon have looked at the
Sheridan murders but discounted Cotterell as a likely suspect.<
And today Detective Inspector Paul Chapman, who led the investigation into the
Sheridan murders, appealed for anyone who could tell police anything about
Cotterell during the ``missing 16 years'' to come forward.<
Officers investigating the murders of Kate Bushell, 14, who was killed while
walking a dog in Exwick near Exeter in November 1998 and Lynda Bryant, killed
walking a dog in Netherton, Devon, in October 1998, discussed the Sheridan case
with Norfolk detectives.<
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said detectives had not placed
Cotterell high on their list of suspects for either murder and were unlikely to
take any further interest in him.<
Detectives investigating the murder of Elsie Freeman, 76, who was found
battered to death at her home in Impington, Cambs, two years ago also discussed
the Sheridan murders with Norfolk police but discounted Cotterell from their
inquiry.<
Mr Chapman said he would contact the two forces again following Cotterell's
confession, to make full details available to them.<
``The view of the profiler that we used is that it is very, very strange for
anyone to progress from burglary to murder in the way that Cotterell has,'' he
said.<
``So far we can find no evidence to link him to any crimes during those
intervening 16 years. But if anyone can tell us anything to Cotterell's
detriment, then we would urge them to come forward.''<
