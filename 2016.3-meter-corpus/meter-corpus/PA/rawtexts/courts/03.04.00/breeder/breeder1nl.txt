SALESMAN GETS LIFE FOR KILLING DOG BREEDER AND MOTHER<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
A former door-to-door salesman described by police as ``wicked beyond belief''
was today given two life sentences for the murders of a dog breeder and her
elderly mother.<
Kevin Cotterell, 33, of Pentney, Norfolk, pleaded guilty to stabbing to death
45-year-old Janice Sheridan and her mother Connie, 79, at the isolated cottage
they shared in Upwell, Norfolk, in January 1999.<
Cotterell had denied the murders since being arrested in April last year but
dramatically changed his plea as his trial was about to begin at Norwich Crown
Court.<
Detectives still have no idea why Cotterell killed the two women but suspect
he may have been involved in other killings or sex crimes during the past two
decades.<
Spinster Janice Sheridan kept more than 20 dogs at the cottage. Neighbours
dubbed her the ``whippet woman''. She was known as a harmless eccentric.<
She had been due to show a champion whippet called Dylan at Crufts.<
The bodies were found by neighbours on January 10 1999 after Janice failed to
appear at the kennels in Upwell where she worked part-time.<
Detectives believe that the bodies had lain in the cottage for several days.<
They found Connie lying on a sofa with eight separate stab wounds to her
chest, one to her stomach and one to her forearm.<
Janice had been stabbed once in the back, twice in the neck and six times in
the chest.<
Though she had not been raped or indecently assaulted, her breasts were
exposed, her trousers removed and her underwear was found inside out and rolled
down.<
Her ankles had been bound together with black tape and forensic tests revealed
that her wrists had been bound in a similar way before the tape was removed.<
Bizarrely, she had been stabbed in her back when clothed but stabbed in the
chest when her breasts were exposed.<
Detectives suspect that Cotterell killed the women on January 7 then spent the
night with their bodies before donning a wig to disguise himself and driving
away early on Friday.<
Officers amassed a huge amount of evidence against Cotterell, a salesman with
kitchenware firm Kleeneze, which is based in Swindon, Wilts, and uses the slogan
``the friendly face of home shopping''.<
A witness remembered seeing a suspicious car parked outside the Sheridans'
cottage and noted down the number G567 PVF. Cotterell's car was G567 HVP.<
Another witness remembered seeing a similar green car driving away from the
house on January 8. He recalled seeing a man wearing a ``Bobby Ball'' wig at the
wheel.<
Janice was last seen alive on the afternoon of January 7. Police think
Cotterell may have tricked his way into the house while Connie was alone and was
waiting when Janice returned.<
Detectives think that the first stab in the back would have killed or
incapacitated Janice and that many of the other wounds were inflicted while she
was dead or dying.<
In the house forensic scientists found Cotterell's fingerprints and a shoe
print matching a boot owned by him.<
Using advanced tests, they also established that Cotterell's DNA was in the
wounds on Janice's chest.<
Later they found a blood-stained Kleeneze bag at his home containing both
Janice and Connie's DNA.<
Cotterell admitted meeting Janice and Connie in 1998 when he was working for a
home improvements firm.<
He told police that he had sold them a window but had never been in the house
again.<
Cotterell had convictions for two house burglaries near his home in 1983.
During one of those he had committed an indecent act.<
During the other he had scattered items of women's clothing around the house.
He was given 12 months probation.<
Detectives said there was evidence to suggest that he had an obsession with a
teenage girl who lived at one of the houses.<
Graham Parkins QC, defending, said: ``In answer to the question `why' I cannot
provide anything at all.''<
Passing sentence Mr Justice Owen told Cotterell of his ``horror'' at the
crimes.<
``These were terrible and terrifying offences,'' he said. ``How they came to
be committed is not clear but that they were committed and committed by you is
abundantly clear. There is only one sentence.''<
Detective Inspector Paul Chapman said after the hearing: ``We still don't know
what the motive was.<
``He is clearly very, very evil and very wicked. Wicked and evil beyond
belief. He is very confident to the point of being arrogant.<
``We cannot begin to imagine the pain and suffering he inflicted upon
Constance and Janice in their own home.''<
Janice's half-sister, Diana Penfold, of Wisbech, Cambs, added: ``I was quite
dumbstruck when I heard that he was pleading guilty.<
``We are just devastated and we just want to know why. We want to know why and
we need to know. We were hoping that we might get some answers during the trial
but we still don't know. The last year has just been unimaginable.''<
Police said a psychological profiler who examined the case found it hard to
believe that Cotterell could go from committing two burglaries in 1983 to
committing two bizarre and brutal murders 16 years later.<
And Mr Chapman appealed for anyone who could tell police anything about
Cotterell during the ``missing 16 years'' to come forward.<
``He meant to kill. All the wounds were to the chest. It wasn't frenzied.
There wasn't blood everywhere,'' said Mr Chapman.<
``We're pretty sure that Connie was killed because she happened to be in the
way. We don't know the motive although many indications are that it was sexual
even though there was not sexual assault.<
``It's a fascinating crime not least because we didn't know the motive on day
one and we still don't. And we won't unless Cotterell decides to tell us.<
``Why he went there we can only guess. He may have been trying to sign them up
as Kleeneze agents. He may have been having an affair with Janice for all we
know - although if he was it was a very secret affair.<
``It's all supposition. Whether he went there intending to kill we just don't
know.''<
