Cotterell lived with his elderly and sick father, Ted, 70, in a run down
bungalow in Pentney, Norfolk.<
His mother, Winnifred, died of stomach cancer aged 65 five years ago.<
He was born in Isleworth, London, and moved to Pentney at an early age.
Cotterell gained a qualification as a car mechanic after leaving Swaffham High
School before joining the RAF Regiment, where he was based at Honington,
Suffolk.<
After being made redundant by the RAF he worked for Norfolk County Council as
a cleaning organiser before becoming a double glazing salesman and then a
representative for Kleeneze.<
Cotterell never married although he had been engaged to Lynne Plummer, 30, who
lives with her parents in Clenchwarton, Norfolk.<
The couple met through a singles club in King's Lynn, Norfolk, called 18 Plus.
Cotterell was at one time chairman of the club.<
Miss Plummer, who is also an official at the club, did not wish to discuss
Cotterell.<
Mr Chapman said Cotterell was a Walter Mitty character who liked to give the
impression that he was a successful and well-off businessman.<
In reality he was a sad failure who was up to his ears in debt and sexually
naive.<
``Kevin Cotterell was one of life's losers. Everything he did seemed to go
wrong,'' said Mr Chapman.<
``He gave people the impression that he was a successful businessman. At 18
Plus he was always first to the bar to buy the drinks and gave people the
impression that he had plenty of money. In reality he was up to his ears in
debt.<
``When we arrested him he insisted he was still employed by Kleeneze. He
wasn't, He'd been sacked because he wasn't very good. All the indications are
that he was sexually naive and frustrated.''<
Cotterell left police plenty of clues to follow but no indication as to his
motive.<
``Whoever did it meant to kill. All the wounds were to the chest. It wasn't
frenzied. There wasn't blood everywhere,'' said Mr Chapman.<
``We're pretty sure that Connie was killed because she happened to be in the
way. We don't know the motive although many indications are that it was sexual -
even though there was not sexual assault.<
``It's a fascinating crime not least because we didn't know the motive on day
one and we still don't. And we won't unless Cotterell decides to tell us.<
``Why he went there we can only guess. He may have been trying to sign them up
as Kleeneze agents. He may have been having an affair with Janice for all we
know - although if he was it was a very secret affair. It's all supposition.
Whether he went there intending to kill we just don't know.''<
Mr Chapman said officers considered a number of possibilities including a
theory that Cotterell may have become sexually aroused by stabbing.<
