The women's bodies were found by neighbours on Sunday January 10, 1999 after
Janice failed to appear at the kennels where she worked part time in Upwell.<
Detectives believe that the bodies had lain in the cottage for several days.
More than 20 whippets owned by Janice were also in the house.<
They found Connie lying on a sofa with eight separate stab wounds to her
chest, one to her stomach and one to her forearm.<
Janice had been stabbed once in the back, twice in the neck and six times in
the chest.<
Though she had not been indecently assaulted, her breasts were exposed, her
trousers removed and her pants were found inside out and rolled down.<
Her ankles had been bound together with black tape and forensic tests revealed
that her wrists had been bound in a similar way before the tape was removed.<
Bizarrely, she had been stabbed in her back when clothed but stabbed in the
chest when her breasts were exposed.<
Detectives suspect that Cotterell killed the women on Thursday January 7 then
spent the night with their bodies before donning a wig to disguise himself and
driving away early on Friday.<
