cottage and noted down the number G567 PVF. Cotterell's car was G567 HVP.<
Another witness remembered seeing a similar green car driving away from the
house on Friday January 8. He recalled seeing a man wearing a ``Bobby Ball'' wig
at the wheel.<

print matching a boot owned by Cotterell.<

both Janice and Connie's DNA.<
