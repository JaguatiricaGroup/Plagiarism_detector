Detectives have no idea why Cotterell killed the women.<
He had convictions for two house burglaries near his home in 1983. During one
he committed an indecent act and during the other he scattered items of women's
clothing around the house. He was given 12 months probation.<
Detectives said there was evidence to suggest that he had an obsession with a
teenage girl who lived at one of the houses.<
Until the time of his arrest last year he had never crossed the path of the
police again.<
Graham Parkins, QC, for Cotterell, said in mitigation: ``In answer to the
question why? I cannot provide anything at all.''<
Passing sentence Mr Justice Owen told Cotterell of his ``horror'' at the
crimes<
``These were terrible and terrifying offences,'' he said. ``How they came to
be committed is not clear but that they were committed and committed by you is
abundantly clear. There is only one sentence.''<
Det Insp Chapman said after the hearing: ``We still don't know what the motive
was.<
``He is clearly very, very evil and very wicked. Wicked and evil beyond
belief. He is very confident to the point of being arrogant.<
``We cannot begin to imagine the pain and suffering he inflicted upon
Constance and Janice in their own home.''<
Janice's half sister, Diana Penfold, who lives in Wisbech, Cambs, added: ``I
was quite dumbstruck when I heard that he was pleading guilty.<
``We are just devastated and we just want to know why. We want to know why and
we need to know.<
``We were hoping that we might get some answers during the trial but we still
don't know. The last year has just been unimaginable.''<
