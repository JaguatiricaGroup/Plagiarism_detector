BOGUS ARISTOCRAT SPUN 20-YEAR `WEB OF LIES', COURT TOLD<
By Dave Higgens, PA News<
A fake aristocrat used his alter ego to weave a complex web of lies and deceit
for 20 years, a court was told today.<
Bristol Crown Court heard Marc St Leger, 51, managed to convince the British
upper classes that he was the Marquis St Leger, 10th Viscount of Doneraile.<
Don Tait, prosecuting, said St Leger set up a bank account with Coutts, the
Queen's bankers, even though he had no cash, and even became a member of a
committee of Irish peers.<
But Mr Tait said St Leger lived in a modest house in Swindon with his elderly
mother.<
He said he had been born Keith Alfred Andrews and attended a secondary modern
school in Kent, where he was born.<
Mr Tait said the defendant began leading a double life in about 1975 when he
began calling himself Marc Philip Justin Onslow Berkeley St Leger Curzon.<
St Leger invented a whole new family tree for the real St Leger family - which
can trace its history back to the Norman conquest - taking advantage of a
dispute in the line of succession.<
He claimed his mother was Joy Chantal Helene de Burgoyne of Paris and Tours
and that he had been married to Marie-Louise, daughter of the Duc de Brissac of
Paris.<
Mr Tait said St Leger also claimed to have two sons but later told detectives
his wife and children had been killed in a car crash in Australia in 1975.<
The court heard St Leger was arrested in 1996 and today he went on trial
accused of a series of frauds.<
He is accused obtaining jobs with Wiltshire County Council and the Salvation
Army using false CV and application form details and attempting to secure a
mortgage with the Bradford and Bingley Building Society by deception.<
St Leger is also accused of trying the obtain by deception credit balances
from the estate of the late Ethel St Leger.<
He is further accused of falsely claiming #16,970 of Invalid Care Allowance
from the Benefits Agency and #2,435 of income support, both using his original
name, Keith Alfred Andrews.<
Mr Tait said: ``Twenty years ago not only did this man adopt a different name
he also adopted a completely different personality and alter ego.<
``Since that time these two personae have been running in tandem. <
``It is the Crown's case that the alter ego has been deliberately used to fool
people, to impress people - perhaps to pander to some innate snobbery that
people may have and perhaps to enhance his social standing - and also allowed
him to mix with some members of the aristocracy, some of whom were fooled, and
opened doors that otherwise would have been closed to him.''<
Mr Tait said St Leger developed a ficticious life including ``a complete cast
list of characters'' who were all ficticious.<
These included a Colonel Villiers whom he said administered his St Leger
Trust.<
St Leger, of Kennedy Drive, Swindon, denies three counts of obtaining
pecuniary advantage by deception, two counts of obtaining property by deception,
one count of attempting to obtain a pecuniary advantage by deception, and one
count of attempting to obtain services by deception.<
Wearing a grey cardigan and blue checked shirt he sat in the dock listening to
the proceedings using headphones to aid his hearing.<
He is remanded in custody.<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
end<
