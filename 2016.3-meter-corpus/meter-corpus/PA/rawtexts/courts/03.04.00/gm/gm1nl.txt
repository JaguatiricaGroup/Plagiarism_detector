GREENPEACE PROTESTERS `TORE UP GM TRIAL CROP'<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
A group of 28 Greenpeace protesters, including the organisation's executive
director Lord Peter Melchett, tore up a field of genetically-modified maize to
prevent the ``pollution'' of nearby crops, a court was told today.<
The protesters descended on the six-acre site at Walnut Tree Farm, Lyng, near
Norwich, clad in white Greenpeace uniforms in the early hours of July 26 last
year, Norwich Crown Court was told.<
All 19 men and nine women, who were arrested at the scene after farmer William
Brigham called police, have denied charges of theft and criminal damage.<
Mr Brigham told the court he had approached Lord Melchett in his field and
told him: ``You ought to be ashamed of yourself.''<
Lord Melchett had written to Mr Brigham two weeks before the action following
a meeting in Lyng citing ``the need for this crop to be removed'', but received
no reply.<
Lord Melchett and several other defendants, who include vicar Malcolm Carroll,
44, beauty therapist Jacky Westwood, 42, and ice cream seller Nicola Cook, 32,
took detailed notes during the day's proceedings.<
John Farmer, prosecuting, said the Brigham family became aware that people
were on their land in the early hours of July 26.<
``People were in the process of using mechanical means to knock the crop down
and uproot it, as well as bagging it and putting some of it on a seven and a
half tonne truck.''<
The maize, a trial crop planted by AgrEvo UK _ an agrochemical company based
in King's Lynn and part of the Berlin-based AgrEvo group _ was planted in early
May last year, was due to flower in August and would have been harvested in
October.<
Several of the defendants told police when they were arrested that they had
acted to prevent the ``contamination'' or ``genetic pollution'' of other crops
by the GM maize.<
But Mr Farmer said: ``In growing that crop Mr Brigham and his family were
acting perfectly lawfully. All the authority had been given to do it; there was
no legal reason why he should not have grown that crop.''<
Mr Brigham told the court he saw protesters treading the crop down, breaking
it off, putting it in bags and attempting to load it onto a lorry.<
``I had asked them to stop, but they proceeded to snap off or tread down the
crop continuously until they were stopped by the police.<
``I told Lord Melchett he ought to be ashamed of himself for carrying out such
actions and told him to stop his fellow conspirators from carrying out what
appeared to be a giant publicity stunt.<
``He said I had only myself to blame because I didn't attend the meeting in
Lyng.''<
Lord Melchett wrote to Mr Brigham on July 15 after Greenpeace and AgrEvo
representatives met in Lyng five days earlier, pointing out the possibility of
non-GM crops being ``contaminated'' by the trial and added that national and
local opinion appeared to be against the experiment.<
The letter ended: ``I do hope, in all the circumstances, that you will see the
need for this crop to be removed before ploughing, as has already been the case
with the field trial near Swindon and indeed in other European countries.''<
Judith Jordan, product development manager for AgrEvo UK, told the court the
destruction of the crop had caused #17,400 of damage to the Government's testing
programme.<
She explained that the crop had been planted as ``herbicide tolerant forage
maize'', meaning its genetic structure was altered so it could be sprayed with
herbicides without being affected.<
It was planted 400 metres away from the nearest crop, in line with
agricultural guidelines designed to prevent cross-contamination.<
She said the farm scale trial was a development of previous trials which were
held in laboratories and part of a four-year voluntary testing programme
conducted by the Government.<
But cross-examined by Owen Davies, who is representing all 28 defendants, she
admitted the four-year programme had not been ``ruined'' as a result of
Greenpeace's actions.<
She told Mr Davies no research had been carried out into whether bees or deer
might have carried pollen from the GM maize to other crops.<
She said: ``I'm sure that has been studied, is being studied and will be
studied elsewhere, but it was not part of this study.''<
The court was also told that the field had been the subject of a High Court
injunction which applied to all the Government-sponsored GM test sites following
a similar action by the group GenetiX Snowball earlier in the year.<
