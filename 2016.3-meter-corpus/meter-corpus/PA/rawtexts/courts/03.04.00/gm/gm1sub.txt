JUDGE WARNS JURY IN GM FOOD PROTEST TRIAL<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
The jury in the trial of 28 Greenpeace protesters accused of damaging
genetically modified crops was today warned not to let their political leanings
influence their consideration of the case.<
Greenpeace's executive director, Lord Melchett, is among the defendants
standing trial at Norwich Crown Court following a protest at a trial site of GM
maize in Lyng, Norfolk, on July 26 last year.<
John Farmer, prosecuting, told the court that Greenpeace carried out a dawn
raid on the four-acre field at Walnut Tree Farm after farmer William Brigham
made no reply to a letter from Lord Melchett two weeks earlier.<
All 28 defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges of theft and criminal
damage.<
Judge David Mellor told the jury: ``This case is not about whether GM crops
are a good or a bad thing.<
``It is not and cannot be about which side is in the right on one of the great
debates of our time.<
``Your focus will be much narrower than that in the context of what strives to
be a court of justice. It will be for you to listen to the evidence, reach
honest conclusions as to the facts and apply them to the law.''<
