  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Farmer told the court the Brigham family became aware that people were on
their land in the early hours of July 26.<
He said: ``It wasn't a gathering of the people of Lyng.<
``The 28 defendants were dressed in white overalls with Greenpeace on them,
who came from all over the country.''<
He said they were uprooting and bagging the maize _ which was a trial crop
planted by AgrEvo UK, an agrochemical company based in King's Lynn and part of
the Berlin-based AgrEvo group _ and putting some of it on a seven and a half
tonne truck.<
Mr Farmer added: ``In growing that crop Mr Brigham and his family were acting
perfectly lawfully.<
``All the authority had been given to do it; there was no legal reason why he
should not have grown that crop.''<
Mr Farmer read out a letter which Lord Melchett wrote to Mr Brigham on July 15
following a meeting between Greenpeace and AgrEvo representatives, which the
farmer was also invited to but did not attend.<
Lord Melchett pointed out the possibility of non-GM crops being
``contaminated'' by the trial and added that national and local opinion appeared
to be against the experiment.<
The letter ended: ``I do hope, in all the circumstances, that you will see the
need for this crop to be removed before ploughing, as has already been the case
with the field trial near Swindon and indeed in other European countries.''<
Mr Farmer said that although the letter mentioned strong local concerns about
the effects on neighbouring fields, that did not give Greenpeace the right to
take direct action.<
``This is a free country in which people are entitled to carry on their lawful
affairs and the mere fact that you do not approve of what your neighbour is
doing means that you can't just ride roughshod over your neighbour's land.''<
