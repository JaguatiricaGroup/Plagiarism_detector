Judith Jordan, product development manager for AgrEvo UK, told the court the
destruction of the crop had caused #17,400 damage to the Government's testing
programme.<
She explained that the crop had been planted as ``herbicide tolerant forage
maize'', meaning its genetic structure was altered so it could be sprayed with
herbicides without being affected.<
She said the farm scale trial was a development of previous trials which were
held in laboratories and part of a four-year voluntary testing programme
conducted by the Government.<
``The farmer is compensated for the loss of another crop which would have been
grown, which he would have produced and sold. He provides the field and they
provide the seed.''<
The crop, which was planted in early May last year, was due to flower in
August and would have been harvested in October.<
But cross-examined by Owen Davies, who is representing all 28 defendants, she
admitted the programme had not been entirely destroyed as a result of
Greenpeace's actions.<
Asked if the four-year study had been ``ruined'', she replied: ``We are
continuing this year, but I am not in a position to say that. The loss is the
loss to the researchers who are monitoring the site.''<
She told Mr Davies no research had been carried out into whether bees or deer
might have carried pollen from the GM maize to other crops.<
She said: ``I'm sure that has been studied, is being studied and will be
studied elsewhere, but it was not part of this study.''<
