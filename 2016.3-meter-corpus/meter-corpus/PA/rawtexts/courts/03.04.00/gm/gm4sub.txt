  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Brigham told the court he first knew of the action on his land when he was
called by his sister.<
He said he arrived at the field to find several cars parked outside the gate
to the field, which had had its lock taken off and replaced by another lock.<
He said: ``There were approximately 40 other people there milling around, some
attempting to get over the gate.<
``A lot of them were treading the crop down, breaking it off, putting it in
bags and attempting to load it on the lorry that was parked immediately inside.<
``There was also a tractor and a cutter which was proceeding to chop down the
crop.<
``I had asked them to stop, but they proceeded to snap off or tread down the
crop continuously until they were stopped by the police.''<
Mr Brigham said he found two strimmers lying around in the field, while the
lorry was blocking the gate and had to be moved with farm machinery.<
He said he had been advised by AgrEvo not to attend the meeting in Lyng on
July 10, two weeks before his crop was destroyed.<
He said: ``I told Lord Melchett ought to be ashamed of himself for carrying
out such actions and told him to stop his fellow conspirators from carrying out
what appeared to be a giant publicity stunt.''<
