MUSICIAN WINS DAMAGES OVER STOP AND SEARCH `HARASSMENT'<
By Jan Colley, PA News<
A jury today awarded #40,050 damages to a man who sued the Metropolitan Police
over allegedly racist incidents which left him suffering from post traumatic
stress disorder.<
Mark Price, 36, of Linden Grove, Nunhead, south east London, was overcome with
emotion as the verdicts were returned at the High Court in London.<
The judge, Mrs Justice Rafferty, put a ``stay'' on #21,000 of the award
pending any appeal by the Commissioner.<
The jury had found that Mr Price, a musician and community worker who was born
in London and holds a British passport, had proved that he was detained against
his will at the roadside in south London on four occasions - in September 1995,
January 1996, March/April 1996 and May 1996.<
He claimed that during the incidents he was quizzed about a TV in his car,
accused of being a Nigerian illegal immigrant - his family roots are in Jamaica
- his takeaway meal was searched for illegal substances and he was accused of
benefit fraud.<
None of the incidents resulted in Mr Price, who is of exemplary character and
was working as a part-time minicab driver at the time, being charged with any
offence.<
The award included #3,000 for the depression he has suffered since the
incidents, #3,000 for post traumatic stress, #9,000 for loss of earnings and
#24,000 in aggravated damages.<
The question of costs will be argued at a later date.<
His counsel, Daniel Janner, said that the case raised serious issues over
police stopping and searching black people and that Mr Price had ``been harassed
and subjected to overt racist behaviour by the police officers of the
Metropolitan Police''.<
Mr Janner said that Mr Price, who has written anti-drugs music which has
attracted praise from Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson, was a placid person who
refused to be provoked despite being humiliated and frightened.<
The incidents had a serious effect on him and he was eventually diagnosed as
having a major depressive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder, which had
improved after treatment.<
The Metropolitan Police disputed that the incidents had occurred.<
Afterwards, a spokesman said that the judge had ruled in favour of the police
on another five alleged incidents - which are subject to appeal.<
As Mr Price had waited three years before starting the proceedings, the
police, despite extensive inquiries, were unable to trace documents and
witnesses relating to the four incidents before the jury.<
As there was no written record of the stops, the police could not confirm or
deny whether they even happened.<
``It would clearly be impractical for police officers to keep written records
of every person that they speak to and indeed, if they did, it could be
interpreted as a breach of the person's civil liberties.''<
Mr Price, he added, could not identify the officers or give exact times or
dates as to when the incidents happened and both sides had been unable to
identify the officers alleged to have made racist comments during the stops.<
In such circumstances, it was difficult to investigate the allegations made to
the court.<
