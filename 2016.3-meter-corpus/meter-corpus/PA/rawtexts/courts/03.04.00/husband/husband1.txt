MAN GETS LIFE FOR MURDERING WIFE'S FRIEND<
By Paul Watson, PA News<
A man who made his wife lure one of her former schoolfriends to their home in
the hope of satisfying his perverted sexual desires was today jailed for life
for raping and murdering the young woman.<
Graham Wilson persuaded his wife's ex-schoolmate to go with him to a friend's
house _ where he raped her, repeatedly stabbed her, then tried to cut up her
body before dumping it in a wheelie bin.<
Wilson, 25, of Caernarvon Close, Grangetown, Middlesbrough, had admitted
murdering 21-year-old waitress Amanda Jane Fulcher when he appeared before
Teesside Crown Court in February this year.<
He was sentenced today by Judge Peter Fox.<
Wilson's friend Steven Staton, 20 _ the murder took place at his house in St
Nicholas Court, Grangetown, Middlesbrough _ was jailed for six years after
denying murder but admitting assisting Wilson by helping dispose of the body.<
The body of Miss Fulcher, of Cranford Avenue, Teesville, Middlesbrough, was
discovered in a wheelie bin close to Staton's home in June last year.<
Mr Andrew Robertson, QC, prosecuting, said Wilson had begun drinking heavily
and started forcing his wife into sordid sex sessions.<
He then told her to invite Miss Fulcher to their home.<
On the night Miss Fulcher was to go to the house Wilson ordered his wife to
leave them alone and go to her mother's home.<
When she returned, Wilson _ who had pulled out the telephone wires at his home
_ took Miss Fulcher to Staton's home on the pretext of calling a taxi.<
Mr Robertson said Mrs Wilson and Amanda Fulcher had been to school together.<
``Wilson encouraged his wife to invite her round. He did this in the hope of
having sex with her,'' he said.<
``Amanda was dropped off by her boyfriend and met Wilson for the first
time.''<
Wilson admitted having sex with Miss Fulcher, saying that it was with her
consent. He denied raping her.<
But the court heard that Wilson later told his wife he had raped Miss Fulcher
before dumping her body.<
Mr Paul Worsley QC, defending Wilson, said his client admitted killing Amanda
in the bathroom of Staton's house because she called his children illegitimate.<
``He agrees he had intercourse with her but denies rape,'' he said.<
``A stage was reached after intercourse where she said that Wilson's children
were bastards and that he was not the father.<
``He asked her to take that back and she refused. He went downstairs and got a
knife and when she again refused he stabbed her in the neck.''<
But Judge Fox said: ``The explanation put before me is wholly unacceptable,
flying in the face of any sense.<
``Much remains uncertain as to how that poor girl met her death but it appears
on the strongest of indications that having lured her in the first place with a
degree of cunning, then either having slaked your lust on her, or in the course
of so doing you then indulged in a barbarism that is revolting to all decent
people.<
``She died a cruel and heartless death and even then the evil in your soul was
not done, with your attempts to dismember and dispose of her with callous
indignity.<
``You are dangerous and seriously perverted and it will be many years before
your release cam be considered.''<
Mr James Spencer QC, for Staton, said his client was frightened of Wilson
after seeing Miss Fulcher's body in the bathroom, and had helped dispose of it.<
Judge Fox told Staton: ``You were as close to her death as could be. Your
crime ranks amongst the worst of its kind.''<
