TOP CHEF SUES US NEWSPAPERS OVER `DRUG BOUT' CLAIM<
By Cathy Gordon and Jan Colley, PA News<
Celebrity chef Marco Pierre White was falsely accused in two newspapers of
having had a ``bout'' on drugs and alcohol, a High Court libel jury was told
today.<
His counsel George Carman QC said the restaurateur was ``shocked and very,
very upset and angry'' when he read the articles in the New York Times and the
International Herald Tribune.<
Mr White, 38, of Curzon Street, Mayfair, central London, sat at the front of
the courtroom at London's Law Courts with his legal team and his wife-to-be Mati
as Mr Carman outlined his case to a jury and the judge, Mr Justice Morland.<
Counsel told the court that the ``bombshell'' sentence in the articles
published in May 1998 alleged that the chef had had ``a well-publicised bout
with drugs and alcohol''.<
He said: ``That statement is not only untrue and totally false, but it is
accepted by these two newspapers to be false and completely untrue.''<
Mr White is claiming libel damages from the newspapers, which are contesting
the case.<
Mr Carman told the jury: ``Ladies and gentlemen, it is for me to say of him -
but I'm sure he wouldn't say it of himself - he is probably the most outstanding
and distinguished restaurateur and chef this country has produced in the last 25
years.''<
Although starting from the most humble beginnings in life, a combination of
immense talent, virtually unremitting hard work, ambition, and complete passion
had brought him success had come his way in ``full measure'', said Mr Carman.<
The case is expected to last three days.<
