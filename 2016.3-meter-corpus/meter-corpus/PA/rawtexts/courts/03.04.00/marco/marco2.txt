  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Carman, who told the court Mr White was the youngest chef to obtain three
Michelin stars and the ``only Englishman to be so honoured in the entire
gastronomic world'', said the chef had felt harassed by the newspapers.<
He had discovered from friends that enquiry agents had been employed to see if
they could get any ``dirt'' on him - any stories of ``sex and drugs and rock and
roll''.<
The newspapers had also unsuccessfully asked for his medical records for the
past 20 years, his restaurant accounts for the past two years and copies of all
the credit cards used in them.<
Shortly before the trial, said counsel, they had withdrawn their defence of
justification and now relied on the argument that the article did not lower Mr
White's reputation.<
``He has suffered nearly two years of anxiety, upset, irritation and no doubt
secret anger at the high-handed, somewhat arrogant way he has been treated by
them.''<
Mr Carman said Mr White had a ``glittering career'' and was currently in a
partnership venture with Granada Group plc and also has commercial interests in
a number of distinguished London restaurants including the Oak Room, the
Mirabelle, Titanic and the Cafe Royal.<
Giving evidence, Mr White, dressed in a dark pinstripe suit, told the jury
that he was brought up on a council estate in Leeds and left school at 16.<
His mother had died when he was six and he believed that his father was an
alcoholic.<
``I saw the destruction it caused in the family.''<
He told the jury he had never taken drugs and drank only the occasional glass
of wine.<
