Mr White said he ``very rarely drank'' and might have a glass of wine ``from
time to time'' during a social occasion.<
``I have never taken drugs in my life. I object to drugs. It is just something
I don't approve of. I think it's very destructive,'' he told the jury.<
Mr Carman asked him how he felt when he read the allegation of a
well-publicised bout with drugs and alcohol.<
Mr White replied: ``I was very angry. I was very upset. I couldn't believe
that it had been written about me.''<
He said he could not believe that the syndicated article was repeated in the
International Herald Tribune just days after it had appeared in the New York
Times.<
Mr Carman asked Mr White for his reaction to suggestions that he was greedy
and wanted a large sum in damages.<
``When I started the litigation against the New York Times and the
International Herald Tribune all I wanted was an apology and my costs. I have
never sought high damages.''<
He told the jury: ``I think I deserve vindication for what they have done to
me and how they have treated me.''<
Geoffrey Robertson QC, for the newspapers, asked Mr White during
cross-examination if he had not felt vindicated when he heard two weeks ago that
the defendants had accepted, after investigation, that he had never drank to
excess or taken prohibited drugs.<
Mr White replied: ``No. Why should I? I never got an apology.''<
He rejected counsel's suggestions that the sentence complained of in the
newspapers did not lower his reputation as a chef or a businessman.<
If the article had not contained that sentence he would have been happy with
the rest of it.<
Mr White agreed that most of the article was a ``positive'' one.<
But the allegation about a bout with drugs and alcohol was a distressing one
and most embarrassing, he said, was having to justify himself ``to the people I
care for and people I do business with'' and tell them that in his youth he had
never touched drugs or drink.<
The case was adjourned until tomorrow when Mr Robertson will continue his
cross-examination.<
