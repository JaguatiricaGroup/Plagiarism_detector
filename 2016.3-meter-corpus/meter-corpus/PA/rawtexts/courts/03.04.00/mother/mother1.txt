MOTHER `KILLED BABY SHE NEVER WANTED'<
By Dave Higgens, PA News<
A 28-year-old mother who never wanted her fifth _ and youngest _ child killed
the 16-month-old shaking him and hitting his head on a hard surface, a court was
told today.<
Elaine Trego, of Milton Brow, Milton, Weston-super-Mare, denies murdering her
son, Jacob Rowlands, at her home on February 19, last year.<
The baby was rushed to hospital after Trego's nine-year-old daughter Melissa
alerted neighbours, but doctors could not save him, Mr John Royce QC,
prosecuting, told a jury at Bristol Crown Court.<
Trego, who has four older children, told doctors and detectives that Jacob
fell on to the floor from a settee, and when she shook him to try to revive him
he started having convulsions.<
But Mr Royce said a number of experts had concluded that Jacob's were far too
serious for this to have caused his death.<
A post mortem operation showed that Jacob had 12 areas of bruising to his head
and face, and bruising on other parts of his body.<
There was also a build-up of blood around one of his optic nerves and further
haemorrhaging under the skull.<
``The degree of trauma was greater, according to the doctor, than would have
been caused by falling off a settee and on to the floor,'' Mr Royce said.<
A consultant ophthalmic pathologist concluded the injuries were typical of
so-called Shaken Baby Syndrome.<
Trego had failed to bond with Jacob from birth and had him fostered until his
father, Joe Rowlands, intervened, Mr Royce told the jury of seven women and nine
men.<
``We have a situation here where a mother, who blatantly did not want this
child in the first place, was content for it to be fostered after birth,'' he
went on.<
``She called it ``daddy's brat' <
``She appears to have caused him physical hurt before and for some reason on
February 19 she used considerable violence towards him, violent shaking
accompanied, it would appear, by a blow to the back of the head caused by an
impact with a hard surface.<
``This violent shaking she must have realised went way beyond anything that
was reasonable.<
``Her whole attitude to this boy was a million miles away from the sort of
warm and loving one you would expect from a mother.''<
