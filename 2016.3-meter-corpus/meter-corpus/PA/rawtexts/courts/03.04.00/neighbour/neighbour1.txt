MAN WALKS FREE AFTER THREAT TO SHOOT NEIGHBOUR<
By Chris Marritt, PA News<
A 68-year-old man who threatened to shoot his neighbour during an argument
walked free from court today after being given a suspended prison sentence.<
James Rodgers, of Coronation Road, Sharlston Common in Wakefield, West
Yorkshire, was given a nine months prison sentence suspended for two years at
Leeds Crown Court after being convicted of affray last month.<
Rodgers, who was not legally represented, had been cleared by a jury of
threatening to kill his next door neighbour after an argument between the two
became overheated.<
The court heard that during the argument Rodgers said he was going to shoot Mr
Butterworth and entered his home before reappearing moments later with what his
neighbour thought was a hand gun.<
An extensive police search found no weapon and Rodgers claimed he had pointed
nothing more than the handle of a bread knife at his neighbour.<
Sentencing, Judge J Scott Wolstenholme told Rodgers he was not sending him to
prison immediately because of the ill health of his wife.<
Rodgers had argued that she had severe arthritis and was dependent upon his
help.<
Judge Wolstenholme said: ``It seems to me that you remain a risk to your
neighbours and they are quite rightly worried about it. My primary concern is to
protect them.<
``This is a charge where a prison sentence is appropriate, but I am not
intending to sentence you to prison immediately because your wife is disabled
and depends on you to look after her.''<
Mr Butterworth and his family have since moved away from the area.<
