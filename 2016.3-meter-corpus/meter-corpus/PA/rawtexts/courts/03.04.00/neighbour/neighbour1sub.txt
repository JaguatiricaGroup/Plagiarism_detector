MAN WALKS FREE AFTER THREAT TO SHOOT NEIGHBOUR<
By Chris Marritt, PA News<
A 68-year-old man who threatened his neighbour with what appeared to be a
handgun walked free from court today after being given a suspended prison
sentence.<
James Rodgers, of Coronation Road, Sharlston Common in Wakefield, West
Yorkshire, pointed what he claimed was a knife handle at next-door neighbour Les
Butterfield (correct) following an argument which got out of hand last April.<
A jury at Leeds Crown Court convicted Rodgers of affray and cleared him of
threatening to kill Mr Butterfield at a trial last month.<
Today, Judge J Scott Wolstenholme gave Rodgers a nine months prison sentence
suspended for two years.<
The court heard that during the argument Rodgers said he was going to shoot Mr
Butterfield and entered his home before reappearing moments later with what his
neighbour thought was a hand gun.<
An extensive police search found no weapon and Rodgers claimed he had pointed
nothing more than the handle of a bread knife at his neighbour.<
The judge today told Rodgers he was not sending him to prison immediately
because of the ill health of his wife.<
Rodgers had argued that she had severe arthritis and was dependent upon his
help.<
Judge Wolstenholme said: ``It seems to me that you remain a risk to your
neighbours and they are quite rightly worried about it. My primary concern is to
protect them.<
``This is a charge where a prison sentence is appropriate, but I am not
intending to sentence you to prison immediately because your wife is disabled
and depends on you to look after her.''<
Mr Butterfield and his family have since moved away from the area.<
