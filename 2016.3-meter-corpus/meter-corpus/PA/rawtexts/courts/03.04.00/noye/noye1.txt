M25 STAB VICTIM `STAGGERED IN SHOCK' BEFORE HE DIED<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
Motorway stabbing victim Stephen Cameron was staggering in shock and confusion
moments before he died, an eye-witness told the Old Bailey today.<
Mrs Heather Titley said she watched from her car as two men fought and
struggled with each other at the Swanley M25 interchange on May 19, 1996.<
``I was driving up the slip road when I saw two men apparently trading
punches. It appeared the younger one was holding on to the jacket collar of the
older. They were struggling with each other.<
``The next thing I remember was the younger of the two appeared to stagger and
look at his hand and saw blood.<
``He put his hands out in front and looked shocked and confused and then went
to the front of his red van.<
``He looked down at the blood and moved to the driver's door.''<
Mrs Titley said she had then seen him on the ground. ``It was apparent he had
been severely wounded.<
``The older man went back to his vehicle, got in and drove away.<
The fight allegedly started after Kenneth Noye, 52, in a Land Rover Discovery
cut up the Rascal van driven by Mr Cameron's fiancee Danielle Cable.<
Noye killed Mr Cameron out of ``anger and maybe pride'' because the younger
man was getting the upper hand in the punch-up that followed, the court has
heard.<
Noye, of Sevenoaks, Kent, denies murder and claims he acted in self-defence.<
More eye witnesses were giving evidence in his trial today.<
Mrs Titley's husband, Stephen told the court the fight was ``very violent''.<
``At some stage the older guy turned and walked away. The younger man grabbed
him and they again exchanged punches.<
``The older man drove off. The younger man looked at his hands. Then I heard a
girl screaming frantically for him to get back into the van.<
``They had been punching at the body, although the younger man kicked at one
stage.''<
He agreed he had told police in a statement at the time: ``The younger man
came up behind the older one and grabbed at his left shoulder with his right
hand and then punched the older man with his left hand. I believe the punch
landed on the jaw. They then exchanged a couple of blows in quick succession.''<
Mrs Helen Merrell told the court she and her mother were looking at a
Rolls-Royce at the interchange and thought its driver was looking at them.<
``But it was as if he was looking through us to something to our right. When I
looked, I saw people getting out of a car and a little van.<
``You could tell by their body language and the way they were walking that
they were angry and there was some sort of exchange about to happen.<
``The younger man was getting the better of the two. The first thing I saw -
it is horrible to say, as the young boy is not here now _ but the younger man
hit the older one. But I don't know, it was a fight and it was not all on one
side. I just saw the younger man hit the older man in the face.<
``The older man broke away and began to walk away. I saw the younger man go up
as if he was going to carry on. Then I was aware of a female voice shouting
`stop it'.<
``I think they started to scuffle again.''<
