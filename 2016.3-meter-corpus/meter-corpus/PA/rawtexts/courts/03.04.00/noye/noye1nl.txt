M25 KILLER NOYE HIT FIRST IN FATAL FIGHT, COURT TOLD<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
Motorway killer Kenneth Noye threw the first punch in an alleged road rage
fight which ended in the death of a 21-year-old electrician, the Old Bailey was
told today.<
Stephen Darling, driving a Jaguar XJ6, said he was on his way home in Kent
when he drew level with the confrontation between Land Rover Discovery driver
Noye, 52, and Stephen Cameron, who was in a red Rascal van.<
Mr Darling told the court he saw the older man punch Mr Cameron in the face
with his right fist.<
``That was definitely the first action of violence when they met.<
``I thought the older fellow got out to give the young one a clout - then the
young one got the better of it. I thought, `Fair enough, he deserves it'.''<
Mr Darling was among a series of witnesses to give evidence on the third day
of Noye's trial.<
Noye, from Sevenoaks, Kent, has denied murdering Mr Cameron, from Swanley,
Kent, at the M25 Swanley interchange on May 19, 1996. He states he acted in
self-defence.<
According to the prosecution, the fight started after Noye ``cut up'' the
Rascal van driven by Mr Cameron's fiancee Danielle Cable.<
Noye allegedly killed Mr Cameron out of ``anger and maybe pride'' because the
younger man was getting the upper hand in the fight that followed.<
One witness, Helen Merral, told the court today: ``The younger man was getting
the better of the two. The first thing I saw - it is horrible to say, as the
young boy is not here now _ but the younger man hit the older one. But I don't
know, it was a fight and it was not all on one side. I just saw the younger man
hit the older man in the face.<
``The older man broke away and began to walk away. I saw the younger man go up
as if he was going to carry on. Then I was aware of a female voice shouting,
`Stop it'.<
``I think they started to scuffle again.''<
Mrs Merral said: ``It was obvious the younger wanted to carry something on
with the older man.''<
She described the younger man as ``angry and fiery''.<
Heather Titley said she watched from her car as two men fought and struggled
with each other.<
``I was driving up the slip road when I saw two men apparently trading
punches. It appeared the younger one was holding on to the jacket collar of the
older. They were struggling with each other.<
``The next thing I remember was the younger of the two appeared to stagger and
look at his hand and saw blood.<
``He put his hands out in front and looked shocked and confused and then went
to the front of his red van.<
``He looked down at the blood and moved to the driver's door.''<
Mrs Titley said she had then seen him on the ground. ``It was apparent he had
been severely wounded.<
``The older man went back to his vehicle, got in and drove away.<
Mrs Titley's husband, Stephen, told the court the fight was ``very violent''.<
``At some stage the older guy turned and walked away. The younger man grabbed
him and they again exchanged punches.''<
Gary Clarke, an off-duty police sergeant on his way to a chess tournament,
said he was at the junction when two men were arguing and shouting. ``They were
remonstrating with each other.<
``I remember the younger one kicking the older one. The initial exchange
appeared to be even. It was obvious the younger was fitter.<
``The older man was coming off worst.''<
Mr Clarke said he believed the older man may be hurt and was getting out of
his door.<
``To get involved in two men fighting can be quite dangerous, but the older
man was getting the worst of it and I had the door open.''<
But he did not get out after seeing the Discovery drive off and thought the
matter had ended.<
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.<
