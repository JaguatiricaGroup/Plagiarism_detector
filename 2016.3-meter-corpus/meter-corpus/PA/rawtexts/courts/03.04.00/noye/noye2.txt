(Memo to CSEs: Note spelling of Merral is correct and NOT Merrell as in early
take.)<

Mrs Merral (correct) said: ``It was obvious the younger wanted to carry
something on with the older man.''<
She described the younger as ``angry and fiery''.<
Stephen Darling, who was driving a Jaguar XJ6, was on his way home in Kent
when he drew level with the incident.<
He said he saw the older man throw the first punch with his fist - hitting the
younger in the face with his right.<
``That was definitely the first action of violence when they met. The younger
fellow was then getting the better of the older one. I saw him throw punches and
kicking. The older bloke was backing off.<
``I thought the older fellow got out to give the young one a clout then the
young one got the better of it. I thought `fair enough he deserves it'.''<
