PRIEST DENIES SCHOOLGIRL RAPE CHARGE<
By Sinead McIntyre, PA News<
A Roman Catholic priest indecently assaulted a teenaged cancer victim while
she was in hospital recovering from surgery, and later raped her, a court was
told today.<
Alex Walker, 45, who has now left the priesthood and is a married father of
two, denies two charges of rape and four of indecent assault dating back 17
years, to between January and July 1983.<
Walker, who now lives in Carnforth, Lancaster, in Lancashire, grossly misused
his position of trust during the time of the allegations, a jury of eight women
and four men was told at Preston Crown Court.<
Mr Anthony Morris QC, prosecuting, said the victim was a 17-year-old A-level
student when she first met Walker, who was 10 years her senior and was chaplain
to her school in Lancashire.<
She was as a virgin, he said, adding: ``She was a member of a devout Catholic
family, and a devout Catholic herself.<
``She was brought up to respect, trust and confide in her priest.<
``To her, her priest was on a pedestal. He was her route to God, and his words
would be the words of God.''<
Walker abused this trust at a time when the teenager was at her most
vulnerable, Mr Morris went on.<
In December 1982 she was diagnosed as having a suspected malignant tumour on
her left thigh bone. She underwent an operation to have this removed just over a
month before her 18th birthday.<
But she was then told by her surgeon that she would have to have her leg
amputated or she would die _ and that and even then there was a risk of
developing secondary tumours.<
The surgeon also told the frightened teenager that chemotherapy after her
operation might leave her infertile.<
She confided all her fears to Walker, Mr Morris said.<
``It was in the immediate aftermath of her operation, when she was in great
pain and at her most emotionally vulnerable and most in need of comfort and
support, that this defendant started to interfere with her and indecently
assaulted her in a number of different ways.<
``He did so while visiting her in hospital under the pretext of comforting her
in his capacity of her priest.<
``This behaviour was, the Crown say, a gross misuse of trust on his part.''<
Mr Morris said the assaults were carried out at a time that the girl was
physically and emotionally unable to resist his advances.<
