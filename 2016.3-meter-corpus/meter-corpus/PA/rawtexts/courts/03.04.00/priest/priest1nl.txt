PRIEST ABUSED CANCER GIRL IN HOSPITAL CHAPEL, COURT TOLD<
By Sinead McIntyre, PA News<
A woman told today how she felt ``destroyed'' after she was allegedly
subjected to a sex attack by her priest in the chapel of a hospital where she
was undergoing chemotherapy.<
The woman, a devout Catholic, claims she was raped and indecently assaulted by
the Catholic priest when she was 17 and a virgin and he was chaplain to her
school in Lancashire.<
``It was like someone had just put a knife in me,'' she said.<
Alex Walker, 45, of Lancaster, who has left the priesthood and is now married,
denies four charges of indecent assault and two of rape dating back 17 years, at
Preston Crown Court.<
His alleged victim was an A-level student when she found out she had bone
cancer in her left leg.<
She had just gone through a traumatic operation in January 1983 to have her
leg removed when the alleged assaults took place.<
The teenager had been told that she would have died without the operation and
that the chemotherapy she was to have could make her infertile.<
The woman told how Walker came to visit her and she confided her fears in
him.<
She told how he then proceeded to indecently assault her during her stay in
hospital.<
Once he took her to look out a window in the hospital and there, as he stood
behind her and supported her on her one leg, he kissed her neck before clasping
her breasts over the top of her nightdress.<
She said: ``I was terrified, I didn't know what to do. I was very upset.''<
The woman said she did not know what to do or how to stop him and thought he
was her way to God.<
She described to the jury how, when she had been transferred to another
hospital out of the county for chemotherapy, he arrived unexpectedly to visit
her.<
She had asked a nurse to take her to the hospital chapel so she could pray and
read the Bible.<
The nurse left her and the priest arrived in the chapel as she was kneeling
down.<
She told the court the priest said he wanted to pray with her but then told
her he wanted to kiss her.<
The woman said: ''I said I didn't him to kiss me. I said I wanted to pray.''<
She claimed he then pushed her back and began to kiss her very hard, before
indecently assaulting her.<
The woman said: ``I felt destroyed, I felt frightened, something died in me
that day.''<
Earlier prosecutor Anthony Morris QC, told how the priest grossly misused his
position of trust during the time of the allegations, between January and July
1983.<
Mr Morris said the priest had assaulted and later raped the girl when she was
at her most vulnerable and on two occasions she had tried to kill herself after
he had assaulted her.<
He claimed Walker had assaulted her in hospital and in the presbytery.<
The court was told the frightened teenager confided twice in a nurse about her
fears over what the priest was doing to her.<
The nurse called the priest and threatened to tell the girl's father, at which
point the priest visited the alleged victim's father and told him they were
having a relationship.<
Walker was then transferred out of the parish but the girl, who married a man
she later met at university, could not forget what he had done, the court
heard.<
She contacted a priest two years ago and arranged a meeting with Walker but
this did not resolve anything and she filed a formal complaint.<
He was then arrested and later charged.<
Walker told officers the two had had a consenting sexual relationship which he
realised was wrong because he had been a priest at the time.<
Mr Morris said: ``He said he did not take advantage of her, he went on to
maintain they had a full sexual relationship.'' <
Mr Morris added: ``The Crown's case is that the victim was not in a state,
either physical or mental, to consent to what the defendant was doing, and he
knew that.<
``He took advantage of her inability to resist him.''<
The case was adjourned until tomorrow.<
