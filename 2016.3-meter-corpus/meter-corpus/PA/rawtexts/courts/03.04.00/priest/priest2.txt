                 14:25 03/04/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Priest
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Morris said the student was still very weak when the assault happened and was
receiving regular morphine injections.<
Walker went to see her after visiting hours one night _ and when he left
kissed her on her lips and tried to put his tongue in her mouth.<
Mr Morris told the court: ``He told her he was a priest who could love her in
a different way.''<
The teenager knew that what Walker was doing was wrong but did not know what
to do.<
Walker then began visiting regularly, and started touching her.<
He took the nightie-clad teenager out of her hospital room in a wheelchair so
she could look out of a window _ then kissed her neck from behind and clasped
her breasts through the nightie.<
The student, not knowing how to react, ``went floppy'' so Walker would return
her to her room.<
Mr Morris said the charge was a specimen one, which represented other
occasions when Walker touched the student through her clothing.<
A week later Walker fondled the student's breasts while she was in her
hospital room.<
The teenager was then discharged in January and sent to another hospital, not
in Lancashire, for a course of chemotherapy.<
She was a week-day in-patient, and went home at weekends.<
One day she went to the hospital's chapel and Walker unexpectedly arrived. He
tried to kiss her, then indecently assaulted her.<
The assaults continued at her home at weekends, when he went to give her Holy
Communion.<
At one stage the student told a nurse about what Walker was doing. He promised
the nurse that he would stop the assaults _ but kept on.<
The student submitted to the assaults because Walker was a priest and told her
that the way he loved her was like a brother.<
``He told her he loved her in the Lord the way Jesus loved his disciples and
it was OK to do so,'' Mr Morris said.<
Walker also told the teenager that she should not tell anyone what he was
doing or he would be moved away.<
``She was in a terrible dilemma. She could not do without him because she
needed his spiritual support but she came to hate his visits and what they
entailed,'' Mr Morris said.<
The student felt guilty _ feeling which Walker reinforced, said Mr Morris,
adding: ``He called her a temptress and said she had been sent by the devil,
that she was evil and leading him astray.''<
