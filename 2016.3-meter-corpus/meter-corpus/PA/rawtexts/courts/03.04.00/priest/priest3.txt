                 15:52 03/04/00: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Priest
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The court heard that the teenager was becoming increasingly concerned about the
situation and that on one occasion while out walking the defendant forced his
alleged victim to give him oral sex.<
Not long after that incident she took an overdose of sleeping tablets.<
The teenager decided to get a boyfriend as a way of stopping the priest's
advances.<
She began her A-levels and the defendant called her and asked her to come to
see him at the presbytery to tell him how the exams were going.<
He promised nothing would happen, the court heard.<
But when she arrived her leg was sore and he said she could lie on his bed and
rest.<
Ten minutes later he came into the room and forced her to have sex, the court
heard.<
The defendant then looked at his watch.<
``He said they had not had sex because it had not lasted long enough,'' Mr
Morris told the court.<
He said his client was so upset about the situation that she threw herself
down a set of stairs.<
Walker then raped the teenager again after a school dance, Mr Morris said.<
He told the court the teenager had wanted to go home but the priest drove her
back to the presbytery after the dance.<
``He gave her a strong drink and started going on about his celibacy and then
took her into a room and had sex with her.''<
The teenager then went to university where her confidence grew and when the
priest came to visit her she told him what they were doing was wrong and she
wanted nothing more to do with him.<
She confided in the nurse to whom she had earlier told her worries about the
situation.<
The court heard the nurse called the defendant and threatened to tell his
superiors to which he replied that there was no point ``because they were all at
it''.<
The nurse then said she would tell the teenager's father.<
At this point, Mr Morris said, the defendant went to the teenager's father and
told him he had been having sexual relations with his daughter.<
Her father was furious and threw him out of his house.<
When the teenager returned from university she was told the priest was being
transferred.<
The court heard the alleged victim later married someone she met at university
but the actions of the defendant preyed on her mind.<
She contacted a priest trained on issues of child abuse and a meeting was
arranged between her and the defendant.<
Mr Morris said this meeting did not satisfactorily resolve issues and a formal
complaint was made by the alleged victim.<
The defendant was arrested by police and later charged.<
Mr Morris said Walker told officers he accepted that the teenager had been in
a vulnerable position but said the relationship was a consensual one and they
had discussed their feelings for each other.<
Mr Morris said the Crown's case was that the victim was ``not in a state,
either physical or mental, to consent to what this defendant was doing and he
knew that.<
``He took advantage of her inability to resist him.''<
