CCTV OPERATOR PRAISED BY RAPE TRIAL JUDGE<
By Paul Peachey, Crime Correspondent, PA News<
The alertness of a CCTV operator meant rapist Kevin Chambers had gone only a
few hundred yards from the underpass before he was stopped by police, it emerged
today.<
Chambers, 36, was caught on camera attacking his victim, a 19-year-old woman,
only hours after being freed from prison where he had been serving a six-year
sentence for another rape.<
The woman in the control room, who is not being named for security reasons,
saw something suspicious on one of the television screens in the control room
which flick between pictures from 82 cameras covering the centre of Ipswich.<
She punched a few details into her keyboard and pulled down the picture on to
a screen in front of her to see what was going on.<
Stopping only to contact police who could also see the pictures, she
``followed'' Chambers as he left the underpass and switched to another camera
which zoomed in on the man as he walked from the town centre.<
Less than a quarter of a mile away, the police stopped the rapist.<
Judge Nicholas Beddard today praised the operator and said: ``It is really due
to her and the speed with which the police operated that this extremely
dangerous man was apprehended so quickly.''<
Tapes are kept of all the footage and police came in to examine the pictures
after the attack.<
The control room, run by Ipswich Borough Council, has a wall of about 24
televisions with cameras covering subways, car parks and town centre streets.
Two officers monitor the screens at all times.<
Community safety officer Jim Manning said: ``It has made quite a big
difference in some areas. In other cases we have tracked people right through
the town centre for a mile or more.''<
With the falling number of police officers on the beat, the role of the
security camera has proved a vital crime prevention tool.<
In the past six years, the cameras have been increasingly used by the majority
of local councils and have provided key evidence in major cases.<
Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were named by a neighbour after being caught
on videotape at the shopping centre where they picked up toddler James Bulger
and led him to his death in Merseyside.<
The Government highlighted the important role of the camera in its
crime-fighting strategy earlier this year when it announced that 180 schemes had
won funding of #33 million.<
Estimates have suggested that there are now more than a million CCTV cameras
in operation in Britain and that anyone in the capital is caught on camera at
least 300 times a day.<
The latest smart cameras can scan the faces of passers-by and match them with
the faces of known suspects. Crime has fallen dramatically in Newham, east
London, following the adoption of this new technology.<
