LIFE FOR DOUBLE RAPIST CAUGHT ON CAMERA<
By Charlotte Gapper, PA News<
A man was jailed for life today for a rape which took place just hours after
he was released from jail where he was serving a six-year sentence for rape.<
Kevin Chambers, 36, was found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court of two counts of
rape after his attack on a 19-year-old woman was caught on security cameras in
Ipswich town centre.<
Judge Nicholas Beddard described the two attacks on the woman as
``particularly brutal offences'' and ordered Chambers, of Mile End Road,
Colchester, to serve at least 12 years.<
The assault came in the early hours of September 8 last year, the day after
Chambers was released from Wormwood Scrubs prison where he had served four years
of a six-year term for a similar offence.<
He attacked the woman in an underpass in the town centre within sight of
closed circuit television cameras.<
A CCTV operator monitoring the cameras immediately alerted police and tracked
Chambers through the streets as he left the scene.<
He was stopped by police and questioned, but at the time officers did not know
exactly what had happened.<
He was arrested two days later in Colchester.<
The victim was so traumatised by the offence it took her five days to come to
police.<
During police interviews Chambers, who had travelled to Ipswich in search of
accommodation, denied having been in the St Matthew's Street underpass where the
rapes took place.<
But his victim picked him out in an identity parade and evidence against him
was given by a facial analysis expert who linked him to the man shown on the
CCTV footage.<
  Judge Nicholas Beddard praised the CCTV operator and quick actions of the
police.<
If she had not been so alert, the defendant could have disappeared without
trace, he warned.<
Chambers will be placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life and his case
will not be considered by the Parole Board until at least 2005.<
He pleaded guilty to rape at Chelmsford Crown Court in June 1996 and has a
string of previous convictions for theft and firearms offences.<
Det Insp David Cole of Ipswich CID welcomed the verdict of the jury.<
He said when Chambers was first stopped, officers were not aware he was in the
area. Under the Sex Offenders Act, Chambers had 14 days to register at a police
station.<
He said: ``Because this occurred within 24 hours, we will never know if it was
his intention to register.''<
