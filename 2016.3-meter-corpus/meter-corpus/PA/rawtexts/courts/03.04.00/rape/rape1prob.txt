PROBATION SERVICE POWERLESS TO CONTROL DOUBLE RAPIST<
By Jo Butler, Home Affairs Correspondent, PA News<
The case of Kevin Chambers highlighted the ``miserable reality'' that crime
could not always be prevented, probation chiefs warned today.<
Chambers, 36, refused to co-operate with any offender behaviour programmes
during the four years he spent in jail for a similar offence.<
Although he was refused parole because of his attitude, under current
sentencing guidelines he had to be released after serving two thirds of his
sentence.<
In the run-up to his release, probation officials tried to fix him up with
accommodation.<
But Chambers again complicated efforts by frequently changing his mind about
where he wanted to go on release.<
Because he was not being freed on parole, officials had limited power to
direct his movements and his offences took place before sex offender licences,
which can last up to 10 years, were put in place.<
A month before he was set free a meeting took place between police
intelligence, probation and housing officials in Essex.<
It was agreed he would report on release to Colchester Probation Office which
would help him find somewhere to live.<
On September 7 last year, when he was eventually freed from Wormwood Scrubs
prison in west London, Chambers was given a list of available housing and spent
the afternoon trying to find somewhere to stay, initially without luck.<
Eventually at 5.15pm he tracked down a room in a hotel in Ipswich. <
Probation officials decided that was better than leaving him to sleep on the
streets and gave him a travel warrant to reach the town, with instructions that
he should report to Ipswich Probation office first thing in the morning.<
However, the next day Chambers reappeared at the Colchester office.<
He had already carried out the brutal attack which led to his jailing today.<
Essex Chief Probation Officer Liz Hill said: ``This is an appalling offence
committed by a man determined not to co-operate with authorities either in
prison or in the community.''<
She said an investigation would be carried out to see whether any more could
have done to stop Chambers.<
But she warned: ``The miserable reality, however, is that you cannot always
prevent further crime. In this case the man was free to go where he wanted. With
tragic results for a young woman.''<
The probation service said police surveillance of offenders took place in only
a very small minority of sex offender cases released from prison.<
