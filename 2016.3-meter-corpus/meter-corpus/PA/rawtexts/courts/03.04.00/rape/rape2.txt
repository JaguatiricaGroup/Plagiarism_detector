  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordering Chambers to serve a minimum of 12 years in prison, Judge Nicholas
Beddard described him as a menace and said women were not safe while he walked
the streets.<
He said: ``These were particularly brutal offences in which a young woman
walking home through Ipswich town centre was grabbed by you, forced down into a
public subway, threatened and subjected to being raped twice over a period of
several minutes.''<
The judge said the experience had so traumatised the victim that it was a full
five days before she could go to the police.<
He said: ``You are now subjected to a mandatory life sentence and even if that
were not now the law I would have imposed a life sentence in any case.''<
The attack was captured on close circuit television cameras and a CCTV
operator immediately alerted police.<
The operator continued to track Chambers using cameras in the street and
shortly afterwards police stopped and questioned him.<
At that time the officers did not know exactly what had happened and Chambers
was allowed to go on his way. He was arrested in Colchester on September 10.<
During police interviews Chambers denied having been in the St Matthew's
Street underpass where the rapes took place.<
A facial analysis expert, Dr Linney studied the CCTV footage and a video
showing Chambers in custody and concluded he was most likely to be the man on
the subway video.<
The victim came forward following a media appeal and gave a statement to
police. She later picked out Chambers in an identity parade.<
Chambers said he had been in Ipswich searching for accommodation and decided
to take a stroll around the outskirts of the town after spending the evening in
a pub.<
