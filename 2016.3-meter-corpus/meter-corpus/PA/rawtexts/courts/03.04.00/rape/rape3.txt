  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judge Nicholas Beddard praised the CCTV operator and quick actions of the
police.<
He said: ``If she had not been as alert as she was and acted very quickly so
the police intercepted the man, he would have disappeared without trace, it
seems to me.<
``There is no forensic evidence. It is really due to her and the speed with
which the police operated that this extremely dangerous man was apprehended so
quickly.''<
Chambers will be placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life and his case
will not be considered by the Parole Board until at least 2005.<
He pleaded guilty to rape at Chelmsford Crown Court in June 1996 and has a
string of previous convictions for theft and firearms offences.<
