TEENAGER BLUDGEONED TO DEATH AT DRUGS MEETING - COURT TOLD<
By Chris Court, PA News<
A teenager was battered to death with 30 hammer blows during a canalside
meeting with a drug dealer, a court heard today.<
A sex act was then committed on lifeless or almost lifeless victim,
16-year-old George Mortimer, Exeter Crown Court was told.<
The young rugby star was then ``discarded'' by his killer in Exeter canal,
said prosecutor Charles Barton QC.<
A 28-year-old man from the north of England has pleaded not guilty to
murdering the youngster, from Glasshouse Lane, Exeter, on January 29 last year.<
The prosecutor said the victim was someone whom the defendant had effectively
named as a potential victim as part of a depraved homosexual fantasy which he
translated into reality.<
The defendant ``took erotic pleasure in doing so'' and committed the sex act
on his victim because of the excitement of perpetrating the act of killing.<
Mr Barton said the victim was well-liked and an ``exemplary'' sportsman who
played for the Exeter rugby club under 16 side.<
From probably the age of 15 the youngster ``dabbled'' in cannabis, a fact of
which his parents Barry and Alice were not aware, said the prosecutor.<
``He used it himself and he purchased and supplied it and shared it among his
contemporaries at school,'' he told the jury.<
``However foolish and reprehensible you may regard that as being, sadly it was
that contact with cannabis that brought him into contact with the defendant,''
said Mr Barton.<
The victim's elder brother Sam, 18, had also dabbled in cannabis bought from
the defendant.<
``Sam had the good sense to give that up. In effect, George took over from
where Sam left off,'' said Mr Barton.<
He said the victim had a girlfriend and had no homosexual inclinations at
all.<
The defendant, the prosecutor told the court, said there was no profit in the
sale of cannabis to George Mortimer.<
``The true purpose was the underlying sexual desire for the young men with
whom it brought him into contact,'' said Mr Barton.<
