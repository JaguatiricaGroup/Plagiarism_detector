After dumping the teenager's naked body in the canal the defendant picked up a
Chinese takeaway meal which he ate with some friends before driving back to the
north of England the next day, said Mr Barton.<
There he washed his clothes twice and cleaned his car twice but police still
found blood in the blue Ford Sierra.<
DNA tests showed a one in 5.9 million chance that it could be someone other
than the teenager's blood.<
The hammer was found close to the body in the canal and experts said it fit
the injuries ``perfectly'', said Mr Barton.<
DNA evidence also showed there was only a one in 115 million chance someone
other than the defendant had sexually assaulted the boy, he said.<
The defendant had called another teenage boy and unsuccessfully tried to lure
him into a meeting the same night, said Mr Barton.<
He had also talked in the past to his homosexual partner about fantasies of
kidnapping, having sex with and killing young boys including George Mortimer.<
``This was an act of sexual gratification of the most base kind,'' said Mr
Barton.<
The defendant told police the George Mortimer had died during a fight with
four men who emerged from the bushes wielding police-style batons, said Mr
Barton.<
He said he had tried to revive the teenager, performing mouth-to-mouth and
first aid, but that failed.<
He did not call an ambulance because he had been conducting a drug deal and
instead threw the body in the canal.<
The body would not sink so he removed the clothing, he told police.<
Jessie Bliss, 16, who had been going out with George for three and a half
months before he died, said: ``He was an amazing character, very popular and
down to earth and very cool.''<
She said he smoked cannabis every weekend or other weekend but she had not
seen him dealing in drugs.<
The teenager said he had told her he owed some money but not how much or who
to. She assumed it was for cannabis.<
On the night he died she spoke to him at 6pm on the telephone and agreed to
tell his parents he was at her house if they called while he went to meet
someone by the river.<
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.<
