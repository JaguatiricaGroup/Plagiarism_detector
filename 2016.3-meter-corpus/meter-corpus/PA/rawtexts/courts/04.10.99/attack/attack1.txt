POLICE OFFICERS `ATTACKED MAN WITH BATON'<
By Shenai Raif, PA News<
A man was beaten up by Territorial Support Group police officers who kicked
him and struck him with a retractable baton, the Old Bailey was told today.<
Crispin Aylett, prosecuting, alleged that the officers then tried to get a
court to believe they were the victims of the attack.<
But Anthony Abramson, 29, was cleared after photographs of his bruises were
produced.<
An internal police investigation then produced witnesses who confirmed Mr
Abramson was beaten up, said Mr Aylett.<
Pcs Jane Bramble, 30, Kevin Rogers, 28, Darren Fenton, 28, and Raymond
Haggett, 29, pleaded not guilty to assaulting Mr Abramson causing him actual
bodily harm and to affray on June 22, 1997.<
Bramble, Rogers and Rogers denied further charges of perjury at a magistrates
court in December 1997.<
Mr Aylett said Mr Abramson was a passenger in a car whose driver made an
abusive gesture to the officers.<
The car, which the officers said they believed was stolen, was chased and the
driver arrested.<
Mr Abramson ran off into Vicar's Close, Stratford, east London, where he was
surrounded by at least four officers.<
He alleged that one of the officers held him on the ground while the other
officers struck him with the baton at least four times, and kicked him. He also
attacked after being carried to the police vehicle.<
``The prosecution say he was given a thorough going over,'' said Mr Aylett.
``That was outrageous behaviour.''<
