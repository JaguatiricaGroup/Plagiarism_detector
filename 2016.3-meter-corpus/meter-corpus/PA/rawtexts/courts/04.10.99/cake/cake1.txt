INMATE MURDERED TEENAGER AFTER BIRTHDAY CAKE ROW<
By Rachael Crofts, PA News<
A teenager stabbed another inmate to death during a cookery lesson at young
offenders' institute after a row over a piece of birthday cake, a court heard
today.<
Maurice Travis, who was 18 at the time, was today jailed for life after he
admitted murdering Alan Averall on his 17th birthday.<
Wolverhampton Crown Court was told the fatal stabbing occurred shortly after
Averall had taunted Travis, telling him he could not have a piece of his
birthday cake, which had been prepared during the lesson at Stoke Heath Young
Offenders' Institute, near Market Drayton, Shropshire.<
The court was told Travis, who was serving a five-month sentence for robbery,
had been bullied and threatened by the younger boy.<
Averall, of Queens Road, Smethwick, West Midlands, was stabbed three times
with a knife which Travis had been using to chop onions on June 28, 1998.<
Judge Michael Mott was told the first wound penetrated Averall's chest,
puncturing a main artery which caused the teenager to bleed to death.<
