John Saunders QC, prosecuting, said the victim had been serving a 12 month
sentence for burglary and taking vehicles.<
He said there was tension between the two teenagers, who did not know each
other well. Averall and most of the other inmates came from the Birmingham or
Wolverhampton areas, and Travis and one other inmate came from the Manchester
area.<
During the lesson the victim was heard by other inmates to taunt Travis,
accusing him of being a sex offender.<
``Travis's response was to say he would get his own back at a later stage. The
teacher told the two of them to calm down, and as far as he was concerned, that
had happened.<
``Other inmates heard threats by Averall, who claimed he would beat him
(Travis) up with others in the gym later, and it was agreed between the two of
them that they would settle their differences later in the gym,'' Mr Saunders
said.<
``That all took place at a very early stage of the lesson and after that it
does appear to have calmed down, and a good atmosphere was going on.''<
But he said that towards the end of the lesson Averall left the place where he
was cooking and walked to where Travis was.<
``It is difficult to say why he went there, but having got there, Travis
picked up one of the kitchen knives used for chopping onions and used the knife
to stab Averall.''<
He said injured boy ran out into the corridor, followed by Travis, where staff
were waiting. An air ambulance was called, but despite efforts to stop the blood
flow, the teenager was dead on arrival at hospital.<
