Franz Muller QC, defending, said Averall had been the ``big man'' of the prison
wing, and had bullied the defendant.<
He said Travis could not raise the issue with officers for fear of being
labelled ``a grass'', even though he was very frightened of Averall, who had
earlier threatened to ``stab him in the head''.<
Antagonism between the two heightened after Averall said Travis could not have
a piece of his chocolate birthday cake prepared by the teacher.<
But Mr Muller said the defendant's decision to enter a guilty plea to the
murder charge demonstrated the great remorse he now felt.<
Sentencing him to life imprisonment, the judge told Travis, now 19, that he
would give him credit for his guilty plea in recommending the length of time
served.<
