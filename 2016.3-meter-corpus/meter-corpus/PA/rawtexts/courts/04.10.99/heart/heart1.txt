HEART OP BABIES WHISTLE-BLOWER SET TO GIVE EVIDENCE<
By Allan Smith, PA News<
A public inquiry into the Bristol heart babies scandal is expected to hear
evidence from whistle-blower Doctor Stephen Bolsin on a video-conference link to
Australia.<
Dr Bolsin, who now works in a hospital at Geelong, near Melbourne, south
Victoria, has been offered his air fares to Bristol for the multi-million pound
investigation into the high baby death rate at Bristol's Royal Infirmary.<
But the consultant anaesthetist, who is widely regarded as the key
whistle-blower whose efforts led to the setting up of the inquiry, has been
unable to meet the hearing schedules because of his own medical and media
commitments.<
Evidence given on a video-conferencing link would be a first for a major
public inquiry in Britain.<
Brian Langstaff, the senior inquiry counsel, told the four member panel that
arrangements were in hand for the link.<
He told the chairman Professor Ian Kennedy: ``This inquiry regards his (Doctor
Bolsin's) evidence as being of very considerable importance and likely to be
very helpful to us.''<
Dr Bolsin joined the BRI as a consultant anaesthetist in 1988. He later
carried out an audit of the performance of the cardiac unit. The audit formed
the basis of a dossier he later presented to a top Department of Health official
seeking action.<
It chronicled the performance, among others, of shamed surgeon James Wisheart.
It revealed that for certain complex heart operations his death rate was double
the national average.<
Dr Bolsin was expressing his concerns over the unit's alleged poor performance
in the early 1990s. Its high mortality rate was finally exposed in 1995.<
Richard Lissack QC, who represents the key parents organisation, the Bristol
Heart Children's Action Group, has alleged there was a ``cover up'' by the
Department of Health, the Royal College of Surgeons and the local hospital
management from 1992 to 1995. In those three years, he claims, a further 44
youngsters died.<
The public hearings are scheduled to continue until Christmas. In the new Year
the inquiry moves into its second and final phase in London.<
No date has yet been set for when Dr Bolsin might give his evidence. But it is
thought likely it could be in the middle of next month.<
The inquiry is currently considering the adequacy of care provided at Bristol
Hospitals during the 1980s and 1990s.<
In all, it is considering around 2,000 baby deaths in its investigation into
the care and management of children undergoing complex heart surgery.<
The public inquiry follows an investigation by the General Medical Council
which found Mr Wisheart and fellow surgeon Janardan Dhasmana and Doctor John
Roylance, the former BRI boss, guilty of serious professional misconduct.<
Dr Roylance and Mr Wisheart were ordered to be struck off and Dr Dhasmana was
banned from operating on children for three years.<
