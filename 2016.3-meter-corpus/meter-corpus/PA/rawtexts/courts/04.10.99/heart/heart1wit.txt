HEART INQUIRY CHAIRMAN ATTACKS HEALTH DEPARTMENT<
By Allan Smith, PA News<
The Department of Health was today criticised for its apparent ``failure'' to
help the public inquiry in the Bristol heart babies scandal.<
Inquiry chairman, Professor Ian Kennedy, said he wanted an explanation over
the Department's treatment of a witness, Miss Catherine Hawkins, the former
general manager of the South Western Regional Health Authority.<
Prof Kennedy warned: ``The Department of Health is not above this inquiry.''<
And he said he wanted an assurance of its ``full co-operation'' in future.<
Prof Kennedy spoke out after evidence from Miss Hawkins, who was general
manager for eight years to 1992.<
She said she was informed by the Department in September that she would be an
inquiry witness today, but had been given no documents to assist the preparation
of her statement and was not legally represented by a Department solicitor or
barrister.<
She was also given little help in preparing her statement.<
Miss Hawkins told how she faxed a copy of her statement to the Department but
claimed it was ``revamped'' after she was told that her comment about a senior
health official was hearsay. She later signed the faxed-back document.<
Prof Kennedy spoke of his ``concerns'' after her evidence.<
He said: ``There may be an answer, but first impressions are that there is an
apparent failure on the Department of Health properly to respond or to take
sufficiently seriously this inquiry's legitimate needs.<
``The Department of Health is not above this inquiry. We therefore expected
first, some explanation and secondly, an assurance of full co-operation in
future.''<
Brian Langstaff QC, the inquiry's senior counsel, told the chairman that an
inquiry solicitor was writing to the Department seeking an explanation.<
The inquiry is investigating the high death rate among children undergoing
complex heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in 12 years to 1995.<
Miss Hawkins said during her time as general manager she never heard any
official or informal hint that there was any problem with paediatric cardiac
surgery.<
But in the late Eighties there were informal hints that cardiologists were
unhappy about referring adult cases to the BRI cardiac unit. They were unhappy
about the performance of the unit, she said.<
The allegations were not specific and cardiologists would not come forward to
make statements.<
``In those days it was very difficult unless you had evidence to name or shame
a doctor.''<
She raised the matter informally with the District General Manager. He told
her that a heart surgeon was later identified as the person thought to be the
problem.<
The surgeon later retired, she said, and thereafter matters appeared quiescent
until the late 1990's, she said.<
She was aware of a television programme in the early 1990s which spoke of
concerns apparently expressed by the Royal College of Surgeons over the BRI
cardiac unit. But the concerns never specified children, she said.<
Miss Hawkins stressed that if there had been specific information - and
particularly from the Royal College of Surgeons - the Health Authority had
powers to suspend surgeons from operations while an investigation could be
carried out.<
Miss Hawkins is the first witness in a week of evidence in which senior Health
Authority officials and hospital nurses will talk about the care and treatment
available at the BRI.<
The inquiry is currently considering the adequacy of care provided at Bristol
Hospitals during the 1980s and 1990s.<
In all, it is considering around 2,000 baby deaths in its investigation into
the care and management of children undergoing complex heart surgery.<
The public inquiry follows an investigation by the General Medical Council
which found surgeons Mr James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana and Doctor John
Roylance, the former BRI boss, guilty of serious professional misconduct.<
Dr Roylance and Mr Wisheart were ordered to be struck off and Dr Dhasmana was
banned from operating on children for three years.<
