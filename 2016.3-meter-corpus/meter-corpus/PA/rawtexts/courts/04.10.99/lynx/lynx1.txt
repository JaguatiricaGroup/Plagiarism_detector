SERIAL SEX ATTACKER ADMITS 13 YEAR REIGN OF TERROR<
By Lisa Salmon, PA News<
A lorry driver today admitted a series of brutal rapes and kidnappings
spanning 13 years.<
Clive Barwell was caught after DNA testing proved that four attacks in Leeds,
Bradford and Nottingham were linked, prompting police to launch Operation Lynx,
which became the biggest police manhunt since the search for the Yorkshire
Ripper.<
At Teesside Crown Court today Barwell, 42, of Clyde Chase, Wortley, Leeds
pleaded guilty to three rapes, one attempted murder, four kidnappings, one
serious sexual assault, one indecent assault and one assault occasioning actual
bodily harm.<
Father-of-four Barwell, who was arrested nine months after one of his victims
spoke on BBC TV's Crimewatch UK about her ordeal, targeted lone women parking
their cars in city centres.<
He abducted his victims at knife-point, drove them away in their own cars and
raped or sexually assaulted them before they were abandoned.<
In one case he superglued his victim's eyes together and in another he watched
her struggle after tying her up and throwing her in a canal.<
Powerfully-built Barwell first struck in December 1982 when he abducted and
raped a 30-year-old woman in Bradford.<
