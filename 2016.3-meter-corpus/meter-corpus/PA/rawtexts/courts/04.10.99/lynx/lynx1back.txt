DNA PROVED LINK IN BRUTAL SEX ATTACKS<
By Lisa Salmon, PA News<
The horrific series of sex attacks put fear into the hearts of women in the
Midlands and north of England.<
Yet until the advent of DNA testing the sadistic rapes and sexual assaults,
which spanned 13 years and three cities, were not linked.<
It was in 1996 that DNA proved one man was responsible for four attacks
committed between 1982 and 1995 in Leeds, Bradford and Nottingham.<
As a result, a massive inquiry, codenamed Operation Lynx, was launched.<
The inquiry, which was also investigating another rape and kidnapping in
Leicester in 1994, involved more than 60 officers from the West Yorkshire,
Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire forces in the hunt for the man who abducted
lone women as they parked their cars.<
He then drove them away to be raped or indecently assaulted _ but not before
he blindfolded them to conceal his identity.<
In one particularly vicious attack in Leeds, he superglued his terrified
victim's eyes together before indecently assaulting and then abandoning her.<
In another attack in 1983, he raped a woman after abducting her as she parked
at Leeds General Infirmary. He then took her to a canal where he put a bag over
her head, tied her hands and feet and pushed her in the freezing water.<
The 26-year-old victim later told BBC TV's Crimewatch UK: ``It was freezing
cold. I just went under the water, then the survival instinct took over.<
``I got my foot on a ledge and managed to get my chin above water, freed my
hands and took the bag off my face.<
``When I looked up he was still standing watching me struggle in the water.''<
She added: ``Not a day goes by without me thinking about it. During the winter
I remember it most, especially when it gets dark so early and I have to go to my
car alone.<
``I have tried to put it behind me, but even now I feel angry.''<
More than 1,000 calls were received by police following the Crimewatch appeal,
and the artist's impression of the rapist was released. However, it was not
until nine months later that detectives finally got their man.<
Lorry driver Clive Barwell, now 42, of Wortley, Leeds, was arrested in the
city in March 1998 and charged after a weekend of questioning.<
It later emerged that Barwell was serving a jail sentence for armed robbery
during some of the period when no attacks were committed.<
The father of four worked for Leeds-based haulage company Arthur Brownridge
and lived with his partner Alwyn Wakefield, his 12-year-old daughter and
four-year-old stepson.<
He also had children from a previous marriage.<
Neighbours in the quiet cul-de-sac where the couple lived, said Mrs Wakefield
was attractive and bubbly, but Barwell kept himself to himself, with little to
distinguish him apart from his clothing, which was almost military in its
neatness.<
But today at Teesside Crown Court the powerfully built six footer looked
unkempt, his hair hanging lank, as it did in the police artist's impression, as
he finally admitted he is a serial rapist.<
Tomorrow, 18 years after he first struck, he will be sentenced for his
crimes.<
