RAPIST'S REIGN OF TERROR SPANNED 13 YEARS<
By Lisa Salmon, PA News<
A ``sadistic'' serial rapist who was caught after the launch of the biggest
manhunt since the Yorkshire Ripper was tonight behind bars awaiting sentence.<
In a reign of terror which spanned 13 years lorry driver Clive Barwell
targeted lone women as they parked their cars in city centres.<
He forced them at knifepoint into their cars before tying them up, driving
them away and raping or seriously sexually assaulting them.<
On one occasion in July 1995 Barwell, who admitted a series of attacks at
Middlesbrough Crown Court today, superglued his victims eyes together after
abducting her in a Leeds car park.<
During another attack in Leeds he raped a 26-year-old before putting a bag
over her head, tying her hands and feet together and dumping her in a freezing
canal.<
He then watched from the bank as she struggled to free herself and climbed out
to get help.<
The victim later told BBC TV's Crimewatch UK: ``Not a day goes by without me
thinking about it. I have tried to put it behind me but even now I feel
angry.''<
Although Barwell's first rape was in Bradford in 1982 and the last in 1995,
detectives did not link the attacks until 1996 when DNA testing established a
connection.<
In 1997 Operation Lynx was launched, involving 60 officers from the West
Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire forces.<
The team was investigating five attacks - two in Leeds and one each in
Bradford, Nottingham and Leicester.<
At the time West Yorkshire assistant chief constable Lloyd Clarke, who led the
operation, said: ``We are dealing with someone who is cool and sadistic.<
``Those women who he has attacked cannot forget what happened and nor will
we.<
``We owe it to them and all women to catch him. This man is a danger to
women.''<
The Crimewatch appeal prompted more than 1,000 calls but it was not until nine
months later, in March 1998, that Barwell, 42, of Clyde Chase, Wortley, Leeds
was arrested.<
In court the powerfully-built father-of-four pleaded guilty to three rapes,
one attempted murder, four kidnappings, one serious sexual assault, one indecent
assault and one assault occasioning actual bodily harm.<
The charges relate to attacks on four women.<
The judge, Mr Justice Henry-Davey, ordered that charges of kidnapping and rape
in Leicester in 1984 and an attempted kidnapping in Leeds in 1993 should lie on
the file after Paul Worsley, QC, prosecuting told the court that in order to
prove Barwell was responsible all the women he had admitted to attacking would
have to give evidence.<
He said reliving their experience would be a terrible ordeal and ``it would
not be right to put them through that''.<
The two women concerned had been contacted and agreed to the charges lying on
file, he added.<
The judge also ordered that not guilty verdicts be entered on charges of false
imprisonment and indecent assault on a woman in Doncaster in November 1985.<
Sentencing was adjourned until tomorrow so victims could attend if they
wished.<
Today Barwell's partner, Alwyn Wakefield, refused to comment at her Leeds
home.<
