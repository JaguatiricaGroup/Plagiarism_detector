A month later he attacked a 26-year-old as she parked at Leeds General
Infirmary. After driving off and raping her, he put a bag over her head, bound
her hands and feet and threw her in a freezing canal.<
He then watched from the bank as the woman struggled to free herself and
climbed out of the water to get help.<
There was then a 10-year gap before Barwell's next admitted attack, at
Nottingham's Broadmarsh Centre car park in May 1993.<
He drove his 23-year-old victim away and raped her, before stealing her cash
card and leaving her in the boot while he withdrew #200 from a cash machine. The
woman was then returned to Nottingham and released.<
In July 1995 Barwell committed his final and perhaps most sadistic attack.<
He abducted a 22-year-old as she returned to her car in Woodhouse Lane
multi-storey car park in Leeds.<
He then superglued her eyes together before sexually assaulting her.<
Detectives believe she was not raped because she managed to fight Barwell
off.<
The offences were not linked until 1997, when DNA testing established a
connection.<
Sixty officers from the West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire
forces were involved in Operation Lynx, which was also investigating kidnapping
and rape in Leicester in 1984 and an attempted kidnapping in Leeds in 1993.<
Today Judge Mr Justice Penry-Davey ordered that those three charges lie on
file.<
