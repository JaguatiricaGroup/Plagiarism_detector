Paul Worsley, QC, prosecuting, said the victims of the charges allowed to lie on
the file had been contacted and had agreed to the move.<
He said: ``We had to think long and hard before we pushed for convictions on
those matters.<
``It would have meant calling the four victims who Barwell has admitted
attacking. And it is for that reason that we have decided to ask for them to lie
on the file.''<
A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: ``We are obviously delighted with
the guilty pleas.''<
The officer said a press conference would be held directly after the
sentencing of Barwell, which is due to take place at Teesside Crown Court
tomorrow at 10.30am.<
