PATIENT DIED AFTER `MASSIVE MORPHINE DOSE BLUNDER'<
By Ian Marland, PA News<
An elderly nursing home patient was killed after being given a ``massive
overdose'' of morphine meant for the patient in the next room, a court heard
today.<
A qualified nurse gave 77-year-old retired miner Billy Brettwood, 30 times the
safe dose by mistake as his wife and daughter visited him at the Seaton View
Nursing Home in Seaham, County Durham.<
Meanwhile in the next room Albert Carr's daughter was wondering what the delay
was with the routine drug which was usually administered to her father every
day.<
It was only when the relatives asked the nurse, Maureen Usher, where her
father's medication was that the mistake was realised.<
But instead of acting quickly to help Mr Brettwood, senior nursing staff and a
GP, who was consulted after the dose was given, failed to take appropriate
action and instead ``drew a veil'' over what had happened.<
It was nearly 12 hours after the drug was given by mistake that an ambulance
was called after the patient had already collapsed in his bed, Teesside Crown
Court heard.<
Mr Brettwood died in Sunderland General Hospital three days later from the
effects of a massive morphine overdose.<
The defendants, who are all charged with manslaughter, are Maureen Usher, 66,
of Station Road, Seaham; Vicky Haswell, 25, of The Avenue, Seaham; Dr Jane
Gustafsson, 48, of Maureen Terrace, Seaham and Michelle Wilson, 36, of
Baldersdale, Tunstall, Sunderland. All deny the charge.<
John Milford QC, opening the case for the prosecution, said: ``The first
defendant, nurse Usher, was the nurse who administered the drug to him (Mr
Brettwood) by mistake. <
``The second defendant, nurse Haswell, was in charge of the home at the time
and permitted the first defendant to breach the very tight code of
administration of controlled drugs.<
``When the error was discovered she rang for a doctor and it was the third
defendant, Dr Gustafsson, who was on duty. <
``She failed to do what she should. She should have advised immediately that
an ambulance was called and realised then that he should have been admitted to
hospital.<
``She advised that he should stay where he was in the home and be observed.<
``The fourth defendant (Michelle Wilson) was someone who took over from the
second defendant. She failed to keep a proper observation of the patient.''<
Mr Milford said even when Mr Brettwood was found unconscious there was still a
delay as the nurses spoke with each other about what they should do, before an
ambulance was eventually called.<
Mr Milford said Mr Brettwodd was taken to the hospital in Sunderland and
``here he was treated, but not as effectively as might have been, so he died.''<
He added: ``Each of the four defendants was, in the submission of the Crown,
grossly negligent.<
``Each defendants' gross negligence was a substantial cause of the death, so
in law each defendant is guilty of manslaughter.<
