PATIENT DIED AFTER `MASSIVE MORPHINE DOSE ERROR'<
By Ian Marland, PA News<
A nursing home patient died from a ``massive overdose'' of painkillers after
he was given six large morphine tablets meant for a patient in the next room, a
court heard today.<
Chronically ill retired miner Billy Brettwood, 77, who was receiving respite
care in Seaton View Nursing Home, County Durham, died on April 18 1997, three
days after the mistake was made.<
The amount he was given was 30 times the safe normal dose, Teesside Crown
Court was told.<
Even so, he could have been saved if nursing staff, and an on-call GP who had
been consulted, had acted properly and immediately admitted Mr Brettwood to
hospital, it was claimed.<
Instead, he was monitored by carers who had not been informed of what had
happened by nursing staff, who ``drew a veil'' over the mistake.<
Nearly 11 hours after the drug was given, Mr Brettwood collapsed in his bed.<
But the court heard it was still nearly 30 minutes later that a nurse manager
decided to call an ambulance.<
Nurses Maureen Usher, 66, of Station Road, Seaham; Vicky Haswell, 25, of The
Avenue, Seaham; Michelle Wilson, 36, of Baldersdale, Tunstall, Sunderland; and
Dr Jane Gustafsson, 48, of Maureen Terrace, Seaham, all deny manslaughter.<
John Milford QC, prosecuting, said: ``The first defendant, nurse Usher, was
the nurse who administered the drug to him by mistake.<
``The second defendant, nurse Haswell, was in charge of the home at the time
and permitted the first defendant to breach the very tight code of
administration of controlled drugs.<
``When the error was discovered she rang for a doctor and it was Dr Gustafsson
who was on duty. She failed to do what she should. She should have advised
immediately that an ambulance was called and realised then that he should have
been admitted to hospital.<
``She advised that he should stay where he was in the home and be observed.''<
Mr Milford claimed that Wilson, who took over from Haswell, failed to keep a
proper observation of the patient.<
Mr Milford said even when Mr Brettwood was found unconscious nurse Wilson
delayed before an ambulance was eventually called.<
He said: ``Each of the four defendants was, in the submission of the Crown,
grossly negligent.<
``Each defendant's gross negligence was a substantial cause of the death, so
in law each defendant is guilty of manslaughter.''<
Staying in the room next to Mr Brettwood was Albert Carr, a terminally ill
patient, who required 300 milligrams of morphine every day, administered in six
50 milligram tablets.<
The court heard strict codes were in place to prevent mistakes with the
administration of controlled drugs.<
Two nurses should have been present, one to check the patient's name against
their prescribed medicine and dose, and the other to enter onto another sheet
the actual dose given.<
But Mr Milford said Usher went into Mr Brettwood's room alone. She later told
police she had been distracted by the relatives of another patient before
entering the wrong room.<
Mr Milford said: ``According to the recollections of Mr Brettwood's daughter,
the pills were in her hand and she popped them into Mr Brettwood's mouth.<
``He swallowed them with some water and inquired `What am I taking these
for?'<
``She replied `It must be a new prescription'. Answering this way, she was
revealing how little she knew about what she was administering.''<
Mr Brettwood had only been admitted to the nursing home 12 days before the
incident.<
He had been discharged from hospital following an epilepsy attack.<
He was a man in a ``very poor state of health''. In addition to suffering from
severe breathing problems, it was discovered after his death that he had been
suffering from lung cancer, with a secondary growth in his brain.<
Mr Brettwood's daughter Amelia Robey told the jury how she ran after nurse
Usher after she had given him the pills.<
``I asked her what are those tablets you are giving my dad, and she said `I
will have to ask about them'. I never saw her again.''<
The case was adjourned until tomorrow.<
