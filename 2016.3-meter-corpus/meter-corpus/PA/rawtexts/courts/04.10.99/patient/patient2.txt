                 14:22 04/10/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Patient
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The retired miner had only been admitted to the nursing home 12 days before
after being treated in hospital for a major epileptic attack.<
He was in a very poor state of health, the court was told, and was suffering
from severe breathing problems, including emphysema.<
Mr Brettwood had also been diagnosed with lung cancer and a secondary growth
in his brain, which was the probable cause of his epileptic fits, the court
heard.<
The jury was told that Seaton View was a registered nursing home. Mr Brettwood
had been in Room 21 and the next room, Room 22, was where Mr Carr was staying.<
Mr Carr, the court heard, was a terminally ill patient, who required heavy
doses of morphine, 300 milligrams, every day. That dose was administered in six
50 milligram tablets.<
The court heard strict codes were in place to prevent mistakes with the
administration of controlled drugs.<
Two nurses should have been present, one to check the patient's name against
their prescribed medicine and dose, and the other to enter onto another sheet
the actual dose given.<
That way, Mr Milford said, no discrepancy in dose or in the identity of a
patient should have been allowed to happen.<
But Mr Milford described how Usher came into Mr Brettwood's room alone. She
later told police she had been distracted by the relatives of another patient
before entering the wrong room, the jury was told.<
Mr Milford said: ``Nurse Usher came into the room with these morphine pills
that were, in fact, for Albert Carr, who was in the room next door.<
``She addressed Mr Brettwood as Billy, which, of course, was Mr Brettwood's
correct name, as against Albert, for whom the drugs were intended.''<
Mr Milford said Usher was a State Enrolled Nurse who had qualified in 1970.
She had spent most of her life working at a local psychiatric hospital.<
The court heard she had retired in 1996, but had been working at Seaton View
on a part-time basis since then.<
The day she gave Mr Brettwood the wrong dose had been only her third shift
that year, said Mr Milford.<
He said: ``According to the recollections of Mr Brettwood's daughter, the
pills were in her hand and she popped them into Mr Brettwood's mouth.<
``He swallowed them with some water and inquired: `What am I taking these
for?'<
``She replied: `It must be a new prescription'. Answering this way, she was
revealing how little she knew about what she was administering.''<
