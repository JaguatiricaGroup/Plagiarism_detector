TWO COWBOY BUILDERS WHO CONNED PENSIONERS JAILED<
By Matthew Cooper, PA News<
Two cowboy builders who conned a pensioner out of her life-savings, leaving
her so poor she had to have her pet cat put down, were today branded
``despicable'' by a judge.<
Mrs Justice Smith said public revulsion against Robert Sheridan and Thomas
Forbes, who also targeted four other pensioners, warranted ``severe'' jail
sentences of three years and three months, and four years respectively.<
The defendants, both 44, posed as ``master craftsmen'' and used the trading
names Dr Guttering and Drips 'R' Us to create an air of respectability,
Birmingham Crown Court heard.<
Sheridan and Forbes, who had no building qualifications, tricked their victims
out of sums ranging from #2,450 to #27,300, netting a total of #45,000.<
Surveyors' reports compiled after a three-year crime spree revealed the often
defective work to be worth little more than #5,500.<
Nicholas Webb, prosecuting, said one victim, 69-year-old Verna Hotchkiss, had
been forced to have her 15-year-old cat put down because she could not afford
vet's fees.<
The court heard she had paid Dr Guttering #4,660 for work on her home in
Stirchley, Birmingham, when in fact the job was worth about #200.<
The victims, in their mid-60s to late-80s, were ``obviously very aged'' or
``wholly ignorant of building work'', the court heard.<
The defendants, both of Walker's Heath Road, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to
conspiring to defraud between January 1996 and January this year. <
Forbes, who has several previous convictions for similar offences, also
pleaded guilty to obtaining #3,900 by deception.<
The victims lived in the Stirchley, Hall Green and Yardley areas of
Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield and Solihull.<
Both men donned Guild of Master Craftsmen badges and carried out often
needless insulation and roofing work, even using Vim and Ajax in ``vital'' work
to drains.<
Jailing the pair, Mrs Justice Smith told them: ``These were despicable
offences. You pretended to operate as respectable businessmen.<
``In particular you targeted elderly, vulnerable victims and in general
cold-called them. In some cases those old people have been fleeced of their
entire savings or have been left in complete penury.<
``The distress and suffering which you have caused is immeasurable and you
must understand that society feels a sense of revulsion for people such as you
and expects there will be severe punishment,'' she said.<
Andrew Jackson, defending, said both defendants had carried on some trade
which was legitimate and had not lived an extravagant life-style as a result of
the crimes.<
