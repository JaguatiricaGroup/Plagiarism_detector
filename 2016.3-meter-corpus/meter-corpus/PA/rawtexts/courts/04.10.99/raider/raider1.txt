STAFF THOUGHT ARMED RAID WAS A JOKE, COURT TOLD<
By Melvyn Howe and Chris Marritt, PA News<
A deaf armed robber's ``Give us the cash'' gestures failed to have the desired
impact when he tried to hold up a fast-food takeaway, a court heard today.<
When Paul Gorman, who is also unable to speak, put on his balaclava after
entering the premises, staff initially thought it was a joke and ignored him.<
It was only when he began brandishing a kitchen knife and used ``finger
gestures'' to indicate they should empty the till, that those working in
``Perfect Fried Chicken'' in Hackney, east London, decided to call the police.<
Realising they were on their way, 33-year-old Gorman, removed his disguise and
waited for them outside, London Southwark Crown Court was told.<
Melanie Simpson, defending, said the attempted robbery last January had been a
``desperate'' bid by her penniless client to bankroll a trip to Co Meath in
Ireland to see his ailing mother.<
``Mr Gorman is unable to express himself in words, only in actions, and he
does express those in anger. But he has not actually hurt anyone.''<
Now, however, he realised how stupid he had been and was full of remorse, she
said.<
Passing sentence, Judge George Bathurst-Norman told Gorman, of Gascoyne
Estate, Hackney, that even though he had admitted the offence, he would normally
have been sent straight to prison ``for quite some time'' for a matter of this
seriousness.<
But because of his disabilities, he felt able to suspend for two years the one
year jail sentence he was imposing. <
``However ... let me say to you that this is the last chance a court will ever
give you,'' the judge added.<
