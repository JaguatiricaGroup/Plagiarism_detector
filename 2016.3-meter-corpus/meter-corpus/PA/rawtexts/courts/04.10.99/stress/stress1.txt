STRESS DROVE HUSBAND TO SUICIDE, WIDOW TELLS COURT<
By Nick Meo, PA News<
A civil servant killed himself after seeking help for stress and complaining
that his job had become terrible, his widow told a court today.<
The claim was made during the first day of a legal bid by the family of senior
manager Jim Cross to sue his employers for more than #500,000.<
They say the 49-year-old father of two was under stress through overwork when
he shot himself in 1993.<
The family have accused development and training agency Western Isles
Enterprise, which employed him, and its parent body Highland and Islands
Enterprise, of negligence contributing to his death.<
The action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh was thought to be the first in
Scotland where the family of a deceased man has sued an employer for causing the
death of an employee through work-related stress.<
His widow Marie Cross, a midwife, from Lochboisdale, South Uist, Western
Isles, told the hearing her husband changed in a matter of months from an
independent man, who loved marathon running and an attentive father, to a man
with no confidence.<
She described how he sought help for stress and had a month off sick before
his death.<
Mr Cross had moved to the islands in 1991 from Edinburgh to take up his job
organising training programmes. At his death he was paid a salary of nearly
#22,000, his widow said.<
She told the court: ``He learned Gaelic after our marriage. He wanted to move
to the Western Isles, that was his one main ambition in life.''<
Before he became ill he had enjoyed life, she added.<
``He was a very, very attentive father, very much involved with his children.
He was a half marathon runner; he used to go climbing Munros in winter,'' Mrs
Cross added.<
``He spent a lot of time doing things for his children. His work was one of
the things he didn't discuss.''<
She said he had always been happy in his work, but noticed a change in her
husband in spring 1993 when he was working long hours with many evening
meetings.<
In March he looked haggard and wasn't sleeping well, Mrs Cross said. <
She told the court: ``It was in March that he first said to me `This job is
terrible'. It was a bolt from the blue - the first time he had ever complained
about it.<
``He was absolutely up to his neck in work.''<
Mrs Cross said her husband saw a doctor and asked to be downgraded at work.<
She added: ``He felt his job was too much, he couldn't cope with it.''<
Soon after he went off sick for a month and was prescribed valium by a
doctor.<
``He followed me almost like a puppy. He seemed to go from someone who was
independent to someone who had to have someone with him. He was just a changed
man,'' Mrs Cross told the court.<
``His confidence was completely and utterly gone. He said he had no confidence
left, his concentration was gone.''<
He asked his brother for books on stress and saw a psychologist through work
in June, but eventually killed himself in August, she said.<
Mrs Cross told the court his suicide note read: ``I am sorry I have been a
lying cheat to you and the girls, Jim.''<
Mrs Cross is seeking #400,000 damages and #50,000 each for her two teenage
daughters. A further #10,000 is being sought for Mr Cross's father.<
The case, before Lord McFadyn, is due to last four weeks.<
