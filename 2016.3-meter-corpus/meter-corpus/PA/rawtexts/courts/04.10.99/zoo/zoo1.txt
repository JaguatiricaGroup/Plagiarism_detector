ZOO LOSES BATTLE FOR VAT ZERO-RATING<
By John Aston, PA News<
One of the country's leading zoos today lost its High Court battle for the
legal right to be exempt from VAT on admission charges.<
Lawyers for Chester Zoo in Cheshire argued that it was entitled to be
zero-rated because it provided the public with education on animals and the
environment .<
But a senior judge ruled that, when it came to VAT legislation, the term
``education'' was to be interpreted in a narrow sense, referring to courses,
classes or lessons of instruction _ rather than the broader sense argued for by
the zoo.<
Mr Justice Carnwath, sitting in London, refused the North of England
Zoological Society, which owns the zoo, permission to appeal.<
The society is now considering whether to ask the Court of Appeal itself to
hear the case on the grounds that it raises an issue of public importance which
could affect many other zoos and wildlife parks.<
Chester is well known for its conservation work, including participation in
the worldwide campaign to save the orang-utan from extinction.<
Jaguar, the car maker, is also investing in the zoo's breeding programme for
its namesake big cats.<
The Society took legal action after the Commissioners for Customs and Excise
upheld a VAT tribunal ruling in September 1998 that the zoo was supplying
recreation, not education, to the public and was therefore not entitled to
exemption under the 1994 VAT Act.<
The Commissioners said the fact that the zoo was supplying recreation to
visitors, with the effect that VAT was due on admission charges at the standard
rate, was ``the only reasonable conclusion that could be reached on the
evidence''.<
Appealing against that conclusion, the Society's counsel, Andrew Hitchmough,
told Mr Justice Carnwath: ``The (zoo) is essentially teaching people about the
animal kingdom, its diversity and the important goal of conservation.<
``It is doing that along with giving the public first-hand experience of the
animals within its collection.''<
