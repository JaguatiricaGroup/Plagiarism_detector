PRISON MOTHER BATTLES TO KEEP CHILD<
By Jo Butler, Home Affairs Correspondent, PA News<
Lawyers acting for a teenage prison inmate were going to court today in an
attempt to stop the 18-year-old being separated from her new-born child.<
The mother lost the latest stage in her battle to be allowed to keep the child
with her in Holloway prison.<
The prison yesterday upheld a decision to bar her from the jail's mother and
baby unit on the grounds that her ``volatile behaviour'' would place the child
at risk.<
Lawyers for the woman, who is still in hospital after giving birth on December
28, will go to High Court today to ask for her to be bailed to a mother and baby
hostel in the community.<
If that is turned down, the child will be taken into the care of social
services at least until a judicial review of the prison's decision is heard
later this month.<
The Prison Service said the jail's admissions board had looked again at the
case but had repeated its advice, accepted by the governor, not to allow her a
place in the unit.<
A spokeswoman said: ``The board did not make this recommendation easily and
carefully considered all the information before it.<
``The main factors considered were the risks identified by the Brent Area
Child Protection Committee which lead to the placing of the child on the
protection register.<
``Brent Probation and Islington Social Services, who acted as advisers to
Holloway Prison, also provided assessments which were cause for concern.<
``All concluded that the volatile behaviour of the mother posed too great a
risk to the welfare of the child.<
``The mother has been told of the outcome and will be offered the full support
of staff and other agencies at what will obviously be a distressing and
disappointing time.''<
The mother, identified only as L, is now hoping that the court today will
grant her bail to a hostel which will enable social services to conduct a full
assessment of her parenting skills and behaviour.<
If the court case goes against her, the baby will be taken into care and she
will be taken back to Holloway where she is on remand for robbery at
knifepoint.<
She was allowed to remain at the Whittington Hospital in north London pending
the outcome of the hearings because the child needed medical treatment after
birth.<
