PROVE YOU CAN COPE AS MOTHER, PRISON TEENAGER TOLD<
By Mike Taylor and Jo Butler, PA News<
A teenage woman prisoner was today given the backing of a High Court judge in
her battle for the right to keep her new-born baby with her in jail.<
The 18-year-old has been refused admission to Holloway prison's mother and
baby unit on the grounds that her ``volatile behaviour'' would put the child at
risk.<
Today she was granted bail ``in principle'' by Mr Justice Richards so that she
can be released with her daughter to a special hostel in Liverpool where her
parenting skills can be assessed.<
Her release, pending her appearance in court on a robbery charge, is
conditional on Brent Area Child Protection Committee giving its approval to the
hostel placement.<
Until that approval is given - probably within the next few days - the mother
will be held at the north London jail and the baby will be taken into care.<
After today's private bail hearing in London, the woman's solicitor, Mike
Tait, said the judge had taken the view that she should be given the ``maximum
chance'' to prove herself as a mother.<
Is she succeeded, she would then be eligible for admission to a prison mother
and baby unit after her appearance on the robbery charge, for which she stood to
receive a substantial custodial sentence.<
The judge had said bail would not normally be appropriate in such a case, but
the birth of the baby had transformed the situation and the mother seemed
determined to secure effective bonding with her baby.<
The woman, identified only as ``L'', was tonight being transferred to Holloway
from the Whittington Hospital in north London where she and the baby have been
cared for since she gave birth on December 28.<
Yesterday the Prison Service said Holloway prison's admissions board had
looked again at the case but had repeated its advice, accepted by the governor,
not to allow her a place in the mother and baby unit.<
A spokeswoman said: ``The main factors considered were the risks identified by
the Brent Area Child Protection Committee which led to the placing of the child
on the protection register.<
``Brent Probation and Islington Social Services, who acted as advisers to
Holloway Prison, also provided assessments which were cause for concern.<
``All concluded that the volatile behaviour of the mother posed too great a
risk to the welfare of the child.''<
The mother has launched High Court judicial review proceedings against the
governor's decision, but the case is unlikely to be pursued if she is admitted
to the mother and baby hostel in Liverpool.<
