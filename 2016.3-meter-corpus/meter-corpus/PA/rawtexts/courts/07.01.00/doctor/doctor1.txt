GP MURDER TRIAL DEFENCE QUESTIONS WITNESSES' EVIDENCE<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
The barrister defending murder trial GP Harold Shipman today questioned
whether the evidence of some witnesses could be relied on.<
Resuming her closing speech to the jury at Preston Crown Court Miss Nicola
Davies QC said that Derek Steele, the close friend of alleged victim Joan Melia,
73, was very upset when he found her dead on June 12, 1998.<
``If someone was in a flat spin how reliable is their memory?'' Miss Davies
asked.<
She said the fact that morphine was found in Mrs Melia's body also raised
questions.<
And she suggested that due to the decomposition of the body the jury could not
be sure about how she had died.<
In the case of Winifred Mellor, Miss Davies reminded the jury that it was the
prosecution's case that the 73-year-old was visited by Shipman, 53, on the
afternoon of her death.<
But, said Miss Davies, there was no evidence Mrs Mellor was at home at the
time the visit allegedly took place.<
Shipman, of Row Cross Green, Mottram, Greater Manchester, denies killing 15
patients and of forging the will of one of his alleged victims.<
