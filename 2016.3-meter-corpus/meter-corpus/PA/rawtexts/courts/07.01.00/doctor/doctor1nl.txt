`EVIDENCE IS UNSAFE AND UNRELIABLE' GP MURDER TRIAL JURY TOLD<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
A patient who died while being treated by Dr Harold Shipman in his surgery
could have already had morphine in her body, the GP murder trial jury was told
today.<
The prosecution has alleged that Shipman injected Ivy Lomas, 63, with a lethal
dose of the drug. But Miss Nicola Davies QC, in her closing speech for the
defence, said there was another explanation.<
She told the jury at Preston Crown Court that Mrs Lomas was prescribed a
painkiller, which breaks down into morphine, before her death at the Market
Street surgery in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in May 1997.<
Miss Davies said the most likely explanation for Mrs Lomas's sudden death was
that the drug pholcodine exacerbated her pre-existing heart condition.<
``That being the case, there is no case against Dr Shipman.''<
She said the murder charge relating to Mrs Lomas was probably the most damning
against the doctor, but she invited the jury to explore the full picture.<
She reminded the court that on the morning of her death Mrs Lomas was very
anxious about her son Jack and that she already had heart trouble.<
Miss Davies also said that it was ``impossible'' for the 53-year-old doctor to
have murdered another of his patients _ Marie Quinn, 67. <
She said: ``Putting it bluntly there wasn't enough time.''<
Miss Davies told the jury that Shipman's computerised medical notes and Mrs
Quinn's itemised telephone bill showed a ``very tight window of time'' for the
alleged murder to be carried out.<
``Factually, this case simply fails on timings,'' she said.<
The QC also questioned the reliability of some of the witnesses. She said one
policeman made a statement over a year after the event with only brief notes to
refer to.<
And the memories of close friends and relatives of the deceased may have been
affected by the distress they suffered when their loved ones died.<
Forensic evidence may also not have provided all the information needed
because the exhumed bodies were too decomposed, Miss Davies said.<
She said yesterday that the foundation stone of the prosecution's case was
toxicology _ but that the tests conducted were ``unreliable and unsafe''.<
Referring to the count relating to Joan Melia, 73, she said: ``You cannot be
satisfied, so you are sure, as to how this lady died.''<
Miss Davies also said the fact that morphine was found in Mrs Melia's stomach
raised questions. She also suggested that the youngest alleged victim, Bianka
Pomfret, 49, had suicidal thoughts two days before her death.<
The court was told that errors in Shipman's notes and documents merely
illustrated that record keeping was not one of his strengths _ not that he was a
murderer.<
Shipman, of Roe Cross Green, Mottram, near Hyde, has pleaded not guilty to all
the charges against him, including forging the will of one of his alleged 15
victims, wealthy former mayoress Kathleen Grundy, 81.<
Concluding, Miss Davies said: ``In relation to the 15 counts of murder the
prosecution wholly rely on the base findings of toxicology.<
``And in the context of these cases that is based on scientific evidence.<
``Our submission to you is that the scientific evidence is unsafe and
unreliable.<
``It is our submission to you that because of the inherently unreliable nature
of the scientific evidence that is the very basis, the Crown's case has to go.<
``In the absence of such evidence, the inferences to be drawn from it relating
to the behaviour of the doctor by the Crown also fail _ and with it so does the
entirety of it.''<
The trial was adjourned until Monday.<
