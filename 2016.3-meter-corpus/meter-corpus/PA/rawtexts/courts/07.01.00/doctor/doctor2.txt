  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miss Davies said the prosecution case relating to Ivy Lomas, 63, was probably
the most damning against Shipman.<
The court had earlier heard that the 63-year-old had died while visiting
Shipman's surgery and her body was found to contain morphine.<
But Miss Davies said the truth is revealed when the full picture is explored.<
She suggested that the most likely explanation for Mrs Lomas's death was that
morphine already in her body from prescribed medication had exacerbated her
pre-existing heart condition.<
Miss Davies said that on the morning of her death Mrs Lomas was very anxious
and physically shaking with worry about her son, Jack.<
``That is why I stress how easy it is for Dr Shipman's actions to appear
suspicious when the underlying basis for them is not there,'' Miss Davies said.<
She told the jury it was ``impossible for Dr Shipman to kill Marie Quinn'',
because ``putting it bluntly, there wasn't enough time.''<
She said Shipman's computerised medical notes and Mrs Quinn's itemised
telephone bill showed a ``very tight window of time'' for the alleged murder to
be carried out.<
``Factually this case simply fails on timings,'' Miss Davies told the court.<
