LICENSE HOLIDAY CAMP POOLS, SAYS CORONER<
By Chris Court, PA News<
A swimming pool at a holiday village where two girls drowned should be closed
until its hazardous gradient down to the deep area is changed, a Coroner said
today.<
Pools at such camps should also be licensed, said Cornwall Coroner Dr David
Bruce as he recorded verdicts of accidental death on 19-year-old Vanessa Gregson
and seven-year-old Tshan Kamara.<
The owner of Honicombe Manor Holiday Village, near Callington, Cornwall, where
the two drowned in May last year, had told the inquest at Bodmin that qualified
pool attendants were only employed at peak times for reasons of expediency.<
But the Coroner said: ``If there had been a competent and watchful lifeguard
there is every likelihood he or she would have been able to save at least one if
not both lives.''<
The inquest has heard suggestions that the two drowned after Miss Gregson, a
strong swimmer who had life-saving qualifications, slipped and stunned herself
while carrying Tshan on her shoulders.<
