DOUBLE DROWNING HOLIDAY POOL FACING SHUTDOWN<
By Chris Court, PA News<
A swimming pool at a holiday village where a woman and a girl drowned is set
to be closed down, it emerged today.<
The move followed comments by coroner Dr David Bruce that the facility should
closed until its hazardous gradient down to the deep area was changed.<
Pools at such camps should also be licensed, said Dr Bruce as he recorded
verdicts of accidental death on 19-year-old Vanessa Gregson and seven-year-old
Tshan Kamara, both from Liverpool.<
The tragedy happened at Honicombe Manor Holiday Village, near Callington,
Cornwall, last May. <
After today's hearing in Bodmin, Caradon council said it proposed to serve a
prohibition notice preventing the pool from being operated in its current
condition.<
A statement said it also proposed to make ``an early decision on the issue of
criminal proceedings.''<
The authority said it ``strongly supported'' the recommendation of the coroner
that holiday swimming pools should be subject to statutory licensing.<
The owner of the holiday village had told the inquest that qualified pool
attendants were only employed at peak times for reasons of expediency.<
But the Coroner said: ``If there had been a competent and watchful lifeguard
there is every likelihood he or she would have been able to save at least one if
not both lives.''<
The inquest had heard suggestions that the two drowned after Miss Gregson, a
strong swimmer who had life-saving qualifications, slipped and stunned herself
while carrying Tshan on her shoulders.<
