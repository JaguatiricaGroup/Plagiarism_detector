  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Coroner said there was no system of licensing holiday industry pools, and
asked: ``Are we looking after our holidaymakers properly, not just in the south
west?''<
``I propose to write to the appropriate authority to make suggestions in
relation to pools and expert inspection of pools in the hope there may be a
prospect of eliminating those pools with unsafe design, unsatisfactory
maintenance and slack operating procedures.''<
Risk could never be eliminated, said Dr Bruce, adding: ``But I believe we can
and should improve on the present position.''<
After the hearing, Miss Gregson's mother Cheryl backed the Coroner's call for
a proper licence system.<
Dr Bruce said statements from two children suggested that Miss Gregson, a
strong swimmer, was carrying Tshan on her shoulders in the pool when she
slipped.<
Pathologist Dr Gyan Fernando had told the hearing that Miss Gregson had a
bruise on top of her head, and it was possible she had hit her head on the side
or bottom of the pool.<
Dr Bruce said today on the balance of probabilities he found that Miss Gregson
lost her footing at the point of change of gradient, hit her head and ``went
down helpless''.<
Tshan, a non-swimmer, would have been unable to save herself, he said.<
The inquest had heard that both youngsters were flown to hospital in Plymouth
where Miss Gregson was pronounced dead.<
Tshan had suffered extensive brain damage, and her parents, Darren Kamara and
Sharon Wong, agreed to her life support system being switched off two days after
she was admitted to hospital.<
Dr Bruce found it ``almost incredible'' that a hazard such as the gradient
should be allowed in a pool to which holidaymakers had access.<
There had been at least four deep end incidents in the pool since 1992 and
before the deaths of the two girls, both of whom were from Liverpool, he said.<
There was no written safety policy or emergency action plan for the pool
complex.<
