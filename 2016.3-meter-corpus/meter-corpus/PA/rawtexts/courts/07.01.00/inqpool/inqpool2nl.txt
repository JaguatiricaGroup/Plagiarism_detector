  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cornwall coroner said there was no system of licensing holiday industry
pools, and asked: ``Are we looking after our holidaymakers properly, not just in
the south west?''<
``I propose to write to the appropriate authority to make suggestions in
relation to pools and expert inspection of pools in the hope there may be a
prospect of eliminating those pools with unsafe design, unsatisfactory
maintenance and slack operating procedures.''<
Risk could never be eliminated, said Dr Bruce, but he added: ``I believe we
can and should improve on the present position.''<
Dr Bruce said statements from two children suggested Miss Gregson, a strong
swimmer, was carrying Tshan on her shoulders when she slipped.<
Pathologist Dr Gyan Fernando had told the hearing that Miss Gregson had a
bruise on top of her head and it was possible she had hit her head on the side
or bottom of the pool.<
Dr Bruce said that on the balance of probabilities he found that Miss Gregson
lost her footing at the point of change of gradient, hit her head and ``went
down helpless''.<
Tshan, a non-swimmer, would have been unable to save herself, he said.<
The inquest had heard that both victims were flown to hospital in Plymouth
where Miss Gregson was pronounced dead.<
Tshan had suffered extensive brain damage, and her parents, Darren Kamara and
Sharon Wong, agreed to her life support system being switched off two days after
she was admitted to hospital.<
Dr Bruce found it ``almost incredible'' that a hazard such as the gradient
should be allowed in a pool to which holidaymakers had access.<
There had been at least four deep end incidents in the pool since 1992 and
before these two deaths.<
There was no written safety policy or emergency action plan for the pool
complex.<
Dr Bruce said it was clear that recommendations on pool safety made by Caradon
council before the May incident were not acted on.<
But the council itself had failed to identify the ``very serious hazard'' of
the pool gradient. If this danger had been taken into account it was difficult
to believe the inspecting officer would not have made a recommendation for a
lifeguard, Dr Bruce added.<
Miss Gregson was caring for a group of five children at the holiday village.<
After the inquest Mr Kamara confirmed that civil proceedings against the
holiday village were being considered.<
And Miss Gregson's mother Cheryl said she backed the Coroner's call for a
proper licensing system.<
She said the pool was badly managed, with no operating or emergency plan, no
lifeguard at many times and no life-saving equipment.<
The local authority seemed disorganised and to have ``fallen down on its
job'', she said, adding: ``I think that now the local authority needs to look at
the way it had managed its inspections.''<
