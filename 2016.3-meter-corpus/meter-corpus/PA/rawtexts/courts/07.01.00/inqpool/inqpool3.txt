  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Coroner said it was clear that recommendations on pool safety made by the
local Caradon Council before the May incident were not acted upon.<
But the council itself had failed to identify the ``very serious hazard'' of
the gradient in the pool.<
If this hazard had been taken into account it was difficult to believe the
inspecting officer would not have made a recommendation for a lifeguard, said
the Coroner.<
Miss Gregson and little Tshan died while Miss Gregson was caring for a group
of five children at the holiday village.<
After the inquest Mr Kamara confirmed that civil proceedings against the
holiday village were being considered.<
Mrs Gregson said afterwards that the pool was badly managed, with no operating
or emergency plan, no lifeguard at many times and no life-saving equipment.<
The local authority seemed disorganised and to have ``fallen down on its
job'', she said, adding: ``I think that now the local authority needs to look at
the way it had managed its inspections.''<
