POLICE CHIEF IN COURT ON SEX CHARGES<
By Paul Peachey, PA News<
One of Britain's most senior policeman made a brief appearance in court today
accused of indecently assaulting two women.<
Deputy Chief Constable Ian Beckett, 53, of Surrey Police, is accused of four
charges of indecent assault at the force's headquarters in Guildford.<
He appeared before a panel of three City of London Magistrates for the first
time for a three-minute hearing.<
Beckett, of Lyne, Chertsey, Surrey, confirmed his name and told the court his
address in a clear voice.<
The court clerk read out the charges which allege that he indecently assaulted
the two civilian workers on December 14, 15, 21 and 24 of 1998.<
Beckett, a policeman for more than 30 years, is believed to be the highest
ranking officer to face such serious charges.<
His court appearance followed an investigation by the City of London Police,
overseen by the Police Complaints Authority.<
Beckett, who is married, was suspended from duty in January this year after
the complaints.<
He told magistrate Richard Dawes: ``I understand, your Worship'' when he was
informed that he was being given unconditional bail to reappear before the court
on October 28.<
Beckett emerged from court with his solicitor and two other companions and got
into a taxi after declining to comment about the case.<
His solicitor, Miss Sarah Ellis, said: ``I have nothing to say.''<
Beckett had been the second in command of the Surrey force since 1994. He was
awarded the Queen's Police Medal in 1997.<
