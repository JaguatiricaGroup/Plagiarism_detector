FINDING OF CELL DEATH INQUEST OVERTURNED<
By John Aston, PA News<
An inquest jury's finding that a cell death was contributed to by police
neglect was overturned by the High Court today and a fresh inquest ordered.<
A judge ruled Swansea coroner Richard Morgan had misdirected the inquest jury
in the case of Jason Tristram, who died at Cockett Street police station,
Swansea, on Christmas Day 1996 after consuming an excess of drink and a cocktail
of drugs.<
But the judge rejected a bid by South Wales Police to block a new inquest.
Police lawyers argued there was no evidence which could lead to a finding of
neglect by a jury.<
Mr Justice Jackson, sitting in London, disagreed. He set out ``five reasons''
why a properly-directed jury was now entitled to consider afresh whether ``gross
failures'' by the police had contributed to 22-year-old Mr Tristram's death.<
The judge described how Tristram was found slumped, drunk and incapable, in a
Swansea street about 11pm on Christmas Eve and taken into custody.<
At the police station, police checked him for weapons and left his jacket
outside the cell door.<
The pockets, which contained a bottle of dihydrocodeine and a bottle of
codeine phosphate tablets, were not checked.<
During the night he was visited 17 times and roused on several occasions. The
last visit was at 7.45am, but at 8.15am he was found to have no pulse and was
certified dead on arrival at hospital.<
Following a two-day hearing in January 1998, an inquest jury returned a
verdict that he had died ``as a result of drug abuse contributed to by police
neglect''.<
It was the ``neglect'' finding which South Wales Police asked the High Court
to remove from the record.<
To that extent they were successful. But they failed to prevent a new hearing
which could reach the same finding.<
Later Ms Nogah Ofer, solicitor for Melanie Powell, the mother of the dead
man's five-year-old son, said the police legal challenge had rebounded on the
force.<
``The fresh inquest will have exactly the same result and this application,
which has cost thousands of pounds, has been a whole waste of time by the
police,'' she said.<
``They should simply have accepted that the first jury had heard all the
evidence and left it at that.<
``A new inquest will mean extra suffering for the family, but they are
determined the neglect verdict will stand.''<
