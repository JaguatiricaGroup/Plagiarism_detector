The judge set out his five reasons for ruling that the question of negligence
should be left to a jury.<
Firstly, there was a failure by police officers to carry out a proper search
of Tristram's clothing.<
Secondly, a proper search ``would inevitably have led to the discovery of pill
bottles, and it would then have been obvious the deceased had consumed a large
quantity of drugs in one day.''<
Thirdly, when Tristram, was examined at the police station he was suffering
from multiple drug poisoning, and a jury would have been entitled to conclude
there was ``a gross failure'' by the police surgeon to detect this.<
Fourthly, it was also open to a jury to find there had been a gross failure to
act on a Police National Computer print-out which described Tristram as
``violent, suicidal'' and linked him with drug taking.<
Finally, the judge added: ``Throughout the night of December 24-25 ... neither
the police officers nor the police surgeon procured any medical treatment for
him.''<
He said: ``I am not saying a finding of neglect was or was not a correct
verdict. That is a question for the jury, not for me.<
``However, the public interest in the proper investigation of deaths in
custody must prevail.''<
