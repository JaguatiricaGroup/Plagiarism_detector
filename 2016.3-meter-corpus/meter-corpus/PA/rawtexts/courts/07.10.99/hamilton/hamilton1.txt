AL FAYED FAILS TO BLOCK HAMILTON LIBEL ACTION<
By Mike Taylor, PA News<
Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed today failed in his last ditch attempt to block
a libel action launched against him by former Tory MP Neil Hamilton in the wake
of the cash-for-questions affair.<
Five law lords dismissed Mr Al Fayed's appeal against earlier court rulings
that the lawsuit should proceed to trial despite argument that the case could
result in a constitutional collision between the courts and Parliament, which
has already ruled on the affair.<
The House of Lords will give reasons for today's decision at a later date. The
libel action is now set to begin on November 15.<
Mr Hamilton, former MP for Tatton in Cheshire, said tonight: ``It has taken me
a year and a half to reach the door of the court. Mr Fayed has spent getting on
for #750,000 trying to stop me getting into court, but five weeks on Monday he
will be staring down the barrel of a gun with my finger on the trigger.<
``All I am seeking to do is to vindicate my character - and Parliament's
reputation.''<
Mr Hamilton is suing over allegations that he received cash and other rewards
from Mr Al Fayed in return for lobbying and asking questions in the Commons
while he was an MP.<
Lawyers for Mr Al Fayed argued unsuccessfully that the claim should be struck
out as an abuse of the court process because the Commons Select Committee on
Standards and Privileges had already ruled on the allegations and the courts
were barred by constitutional law from questioning Parliament's decisions.<
Mr Al Fayed is being sued over allegations he made in a Channel 4 Dispatches
programme in January 1997 that Mr Hamilton received from him cash, free
shopping, gift vouchers, and a holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for tabling
Parliamentary questions.<
