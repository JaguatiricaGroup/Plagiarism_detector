KNICKER SNATCHER SNARED AGAIN<
By Melvyn Howe, PA News<
A serial knicker thief who amassed an estimated #50,000 worth of women's
underwear was ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment today.<
Nadarajah Jeyakumar, 38, who spent four years building up his collection, was
eventually caught when a gang of his fed-up victims decided to lay his
night-time antics to rest.<
They packed one of their clothes lines with an irresistible array of briefs,
recruited an ex-police dog and then patiently lay in wait.<
Not long afterwards the dog picked up the unmarried van-driver's scent and
alerted the women.<
They gave chase and quickly cornered him in a nearby garden.<
Police who searched him found he was wearing a pair of knickers and a lady's
swimsuit.<
Bearded Jeyakumar claimed they were to support his hernia, but when officers
searched him home in Sunleigh Road, Alperton, north west London, they found
several sacks full of women's underwear.<
London's Brent Magistrates' Court was told he was subsequently convicted of
six counts of theft and one of attempted theft at Harrow Crown Court last June,
given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay #700 costs.<
But several days later the lingerie lover was at it again.<
Fortunately victim Helena Confait, 25, of Heather Park Drive, Alperton, was
ready for his 5am foray.<
Jeyakumar tripped a light sensor and was spotted holding a pair of white
panties.<
Within seconds he had been wrestled to the ground by the woman's
ex-paratrooper boyfriend.<
Magistrates heard that when police asked why he had knickers stuffed in the
lining of his jacket, he maintained he had ``sensitive skin'' and needed them to
mop his brow.<
Officers again searched his home and this time discovered 11 sacks of assorted
female undergarments.<
In evidence he insisted they had been left by a couple of former girlfriends.<
He added that far from trying to steal Ms Confait's underwear, he had been
running from two men.<
Magistrates who rejected his claims at an earlier hearing and convicted him of
his latest offence, decided today that they would be assisted by a full
psychiatric assessment before sentencing him.<
He was allowed bail.<
