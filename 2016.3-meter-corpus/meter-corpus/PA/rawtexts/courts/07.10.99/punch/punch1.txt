BOXER CLEARED OF ASSAULTING WOMEN AT NIGHTCLUB<
Boxing champion Garry Delany was today cleared of assaulting two young women
in a nightclub punch-up.<
Flame-haired 6ft 6ins tall Delany breathed a huge sigh of relief and his
blonde girlfriend, part-time model Jody Marsh, burst into tears of relief as the
jury returned its verdict.<
Commonwealth light heavyweight champion Delany was found not guilty of
slapping and punching 23-year-old sales and marketing assistant Samantha Bevis
at Hollywoods nightclub in Romford, Essex.<
He was also acquitted of putting his hand around the throat of club
receptionist Pippa Kendall, also 23.<
Wood Green Crown Court was told the women had been attacked following a
drink-throwing incident on July 4, 1998.<
But the boxer, of South End Road, Hornchurch, Essex, showed the jury injuries
to himself, including a bitten ear and a huge scar where nine metal screws were
inserted into his broken ankle.<
The injuries were allegedly caused by bouncers who he claimed set upon him as
he tried to leave the club that night.<
The 29-year-old, who now fights at cruiserweight level, denied assault
occasioning actual bodily harm on Miss Bevis and common assault against Miss
Kendall.<
He claimed the club's staff had concocted a ``smokescreen'' to shelter the
bouncers from any wrongdoing.<
He also claimed that CCTV footage had been tampered with.<
He told the jury: ``Yes, I'm a boxer but that doesn't mean I like fighting.
I'm not a violent person.<
``It's all a pack of lies. I do not hit women. I never have and I never
will.''<
His girlfriend, who had previously worked in Hollywoods' promotions
department, gave evidence that at least one of the alleged victims was part of a
gang who ``hounded'' her out of her job and who threatened her with violence.<
