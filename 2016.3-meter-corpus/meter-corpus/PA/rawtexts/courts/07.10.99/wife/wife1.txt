DRIVING INSTRUCTOR GETS LIFE FOR WIFE'S MURDER<
A driving instructor who stabbed his estranged wife to death then slashed his
wrists and lay down beside her was jailed for life today.<
Darryl Conway, 41, of St Norbert Drive, Kirk Hallam, near Ilkestone,
Derbyshire, was found guilty of the murder of his 38-year-old wife Penny.<
A jury at Nottingham Crown Court rejected his claim that he was guilty of
manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility because he was suffering
from depression.<
The court was told he killed his wife after she refused to have him back. He
had no previous convictions.<
He told the jury he had no recollection of how his wife received 19 stab
wounds to her neck, chest and back, 13 of them potentially fatal.<
The court heard Conway made an emergency telephone call to police saying: ``Me
and the wife aren't very well.''<
Ambulancemen arrived to find the couple lying on the kitchen floor of the
former matrimonial home in Beckley Road, Broxtowe, Nottingham on December 12
last year.<
Mrs Conway had a carving knife sticking out of her chest with only the handle
visible.<
Her husband had cuts to both wrists. A paramedic shook him and said: ``I know
you're not unconscious.''<
Conway, still with his eyes shut, said: ``How's Penny?'' He was taken to
hospital but did not have life threatening injuries.<
The court heard the couple had been married for 19 years and had two children.
He moved out last year when the marriage broke down but continued to visit the
children.<
One of his driving pupils, Sarah Rice, said Conway told her he wanted to get
back with his wife but she boasted about having sex with other men. He said he
wanted to kill her.<
``I thought it was a figure of speech but he said `No, seriously'.''<
The prosecution said Conway baby-sat for his wife while she had a night out.
He waited in the dark for her return then stabbed her to death.<
