TOURISTS FACE COURT ON AIR RAGE CHARGE<
By James Morrison, PA News<
Five Irish tourists were today due to be committed for trial in connection
with an alleged air rage incident which led to a plane being diverted to
America.<
Myles Connors, Francis Coyle, Angela O'Driscoll, Elizabeth O'Driscoll and
Josephine Cooper, all of Thurston Road, Lewisham, south London, have been
remanded on unconditional bail to appear before Crawley magistrates this
morning.<
At an earlier hearing, Connors, 36, and Coyle, 40, each pleaded not guilty to
affray and acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft.<
Elizabeth O'Driscoll, 34, Angela O'Driscoll, 39, and Cooper, 19, have each
denied being drunk on an aircraft.<
The five defendants were among a group of 12 holidaymakers ordered off an
Airtours flight from Gatwick to Montego Bay after it was diverted to Norfolk,
Virginia, on January 31.<
They were stranded for two days, before being flown home by North West
Airlines.<
Magistrates were originally due to commit the five to the crown court for
trial two weeks ago, but the case was adjourned until today so prosecution
papers could be studied by the defence.<
