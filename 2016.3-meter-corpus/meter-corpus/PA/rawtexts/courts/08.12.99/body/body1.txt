JURY RETIRES IN VICE GIRL MURDER CASE<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
An Old Bailey jury retired to consider its verdict today in the trial of a
lorry driver accused of murdering a vice girl and burying her body in a shallow
grave in woodland.<
David Smith, 43, of Markhole Close, Hampton, west London, denies murdering
Amanda Walker, 21, originally from Leeds, in April this year.<
The prosecution alleges Smith picked up Miss Walker, a prostitute, in central
London after attending ``a party for broad-minded adults''.<
He had sex with her, killed and mutilated her and dumped her blood-stained
clothing on a footpath a mile from his home, William Boyce, prosecuting, has
told the court.<
Smith allegedly buried her body near the Royal Horticultural Society grounds
in Wisley, Surrey, where she was found by an employee, covered with leaves and
branches, nearly six weeks later.<
Smith told the jury in his defence that he petted with Miss Walker before she
was murdered _ but denied killing her.<
``I swear to God I did not murder her,'' Smith maintained, saying that after
their meeting, they went off in separate directions and he did not see Miss
Walker again.<
