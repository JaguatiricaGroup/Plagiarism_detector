KILLER CLEARED OF VICE GIRL MURDER SIX YEARS AGO<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
Ripper-style killer David Smith was cleared of an almost carbon copy murder of
another vice girl at the Old Bailey six years ago.<
He was acquitted after his defence counsel accused police in court of
suppressing evidence and incompetence.<
Police emphatically denied the allegation. They closed the case _ saying they
were not looking for anyone else in connection with it.<
At the time, Smith had admitted paying a 33-year-old prostitute _ Sarah Crump
_ for sex on the night she died. But he denied he murdered her.<
Miss Crump, originally from Lincoln, led a double life, working as a
psychiatric nurse by day and for an escort agency at night.<
Her body, infested with insects, was found in her Southall, west London, home
in August, 1991.<
She had been knifed and her dead, or dying body had been ``dreadfully
mutilated''.<
She was butchered in an almost identical pattern to operation scars borne by a
woman Smith had once loved. That woman, known only as Janet, had rejected him.<
The prosecution suggested that Smith murdered Miss Crump after this _ and a
series of rejections by women.<
``The coincidence between Sarah's injuries and the scars on Janet _ the
subject of his infatuation and rejection _ will be for you to judge,'' the
prosecution had told the jury trying him in 1993.<
But Mr Ronald Thwaites, QC, defending, told the jury that police were
convinced Smith was the murderer and had set out to prove it ``at all costs''.<
``That is a very dangerous course to follow. In this case it has caused them
to mislead and distort in the most appalling way,'' he said.<
The defence maintained that police suppressed evidence by failing to disclose
unidentified fingerprints found on Miss Crump's door handle and the drawer under
her bed.<
Mr Thwaites said the prints belonged to the real killer _ none of Smith's
fingerprints were found in the house.<
From reports of the case then, Mr Thwaites also attacked Detective Inspector
Jill McTigue, who led the murder inquiry, saying: ``This case was her first
murder as a detective inspector and unfortunately she was not equal to it.''<
Miss McTigue, an Australian who was a qualified pilot, came to England in the
1970s and joined the Metropolitan Police.<
She said officers had bent over backwards to alert the defence of all the
evidence. She said after the 1993 trial she did not take it personally _ it was
not her job to attack the defence.<
The officer, who has since graduated from Cambridge University, is now in
charge of a specialist policy unit.<
She was not available for comment at the end of the current trial.<
