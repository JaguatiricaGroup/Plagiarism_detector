UNSOLVED ATTACKS RE-EXAMINED AS RAPIST IS JAILED<
By Pat Clarke, Old Bailey Correspondent, PA News<
A sadistic Ripper-style killer, jailed for life at the Old Bailey today, faces
further police investigations into other unsolved attacks on women throughout
the UK. <
David Smith, described by the judge as ``extremely dangerous to women and
likely to remain so'', murdered and mutilated 21-year-old vice girl Amanda
Walker last April.<
He then buried her in a shallow leafy grave at a Surrey beauty spot frequented
by lovers.<
Six years ago, Smith _ who killed to satisfy his perverted sexual obsession _
was cleared at the Old Bailey of the almost identical murder of another
call-girl, Sarah Crump.<
His defence counsel had then accused police in court of suppressing evidence
and incompetence. Smith, a sadistic martial arts expert, had thanked the jury as
he left court.<
Police emphatically denied the defence allegation. They closed the case,
saying they were not looking for anyone else in connection with it.<
Today Miss Crump's mother, Pat Rhodes, said she always thought Smith would
kill in the future.<
In a statement issued after Smith was jailed, she said: ``We are very relieved
with this result today. Nothing will bring Sarah back, we know that, but we feel
there has been unfinished business while Smith has been free.<
She sent condolences to Miss Walker's family.<
The Recorder of London, Judge Michael Hyam, told Smith it was evident he
killed Miss Walker ``to satisfy your perverted sexual obsession. You are without
pity or remorse''.<
Smith, 43, from Hampton, west London, had denied murdering Miss Walker.<
As the 6ft 3ins 18 stone lorry driver was led emotionless to cells today, it
emerged that police may now interview him about other unsolved attacks on women
all over the country.<
Smith's details, together with those of Miss Walker's murder, have been
circulated to all UK forces.<
Some have already shown interest but police are not giving details.<
Miss Walker's maggot-ridden body was found in a shallow leafy grave near the
Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley in Surrey nearly six weeks after
she disappeared.<
It was a spot renowned for sex romps and orgies.<
Miss Walker ``almost certainly'' was killed there by Smith, nicknamed
``Lurch'' by workmates because of his size and speech. He frequented the Wisley
woodlands as a voyeur, watching others making love.<
Smith had picked up Miss Walker after attending a commercially organised
``party for broad-minded adults'' in Ilford, Essex, prosecutor William Boyce had
told the jury.<
When he left ``he felt randy and was looking for a bit of fun'', the court
heard. Police say he wanted to control a woman totally.<
He went to Paddington seeking out a prostitute. Here, Miss Walker, a newcomer
to street life, crossed his path.<
Smith had sex with her, killed her and later dumped her blood-stained clothing
on a footpath a mile from his home, Mr Boyce told the court.<
Smith had already been arrested by the time her body was discovered. Police
had trawled known sex offenders in the area where Miss Walker's clothes were
found earlier. His DNA matched blood found on her clothing.<
While in prison awaiting trial for Amanda Walker's murder, Smith boasted of
murdering her to his cell-mate, Stephen Williams.<
It was his undoing, for tattooed Williams, himself a sex offender, was
appalled by what he had heard and told police.<
Smith told Williams that he had bound Amanda Walker, wrapped her in polythene
and cut her with a knife ``downstairs'' before and after having sex with her.<
The martial arts expert, who knew the points of the body to put pressure on in
order to inflict pain and kill, said he had put his hand on her nose and mouth.
That was when she died.<
According to detectives, he showed no remorse and rehearsed a story to tell
police, believing he could get away with murder.<
Faced with forensic evidence linking him by DNA to Amanda Walker's blood,
Smith made up a story, saying he had met her, but had left her alive.<
Miss Walker was from a respectable family in Swarcliffe, Leeds, who had been
trying to get her to give up her street life.<
Her relatives did not attend Smith's trial.<
