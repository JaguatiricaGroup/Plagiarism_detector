DOUBLE LIFE OF SADISTIC SEX KILLER<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
Sadistic sex killer David Smith led a classic double life which had chilling
parallels to the activities of the Yorkshire Ripper.<
By day, Smith, a lorry driver, was a polite, softly spoken conscientious
employee who kept himself to himself and lived with his mother in an
immaculately kept house in suburban south-west London.<
He had been married, but went back to his mother's home when a relationship
failed.<
But by night he moved in a twilight world of prostitutes and sadomasochism.
Although a convicted rapist, Smith ran his own escort agency _ hiring girls out
for #250 a time for sex, and banking a cut of their takings.<
Smith said he did not use his own girls to satisfy his own sexual needs _ that
would be mixing business with pleasure.<
Instead, the Jekyll and Hyde character stalked known vice areas, took the
numbers of call girls from telephone kiosks, and joined al fresco sex romps on
Wisley common, Surrey.<
Smith, a powerfully-built man, weighing 18 stone and 6ft 3ins tall, was known
to fellow drivers as Lurch as his build and speech were reminiscent of the
butler in the Addams Family television series.<
He was also dubbed the honey monster _ after the large, hairy and ungainly
creature featured in a cereal advertisement.<
Because of his size, Smith was attracted to well-built and ``voluptuous''
women whom he believed could meet his sexual needs.<
When he met petite prostitute Amanda Walker in Paddington, west London, in
April, he knew she would never satisfy him properly.<
But Smith had to dominate women totally _ he was turned on by subjugating them
to his will through inflicting pain.<
While in prison awaiting trial accused of Amanda Walker's murder, he shared
intimate secrets of his obsession with domination and sadomasochism with his
cell-mate, Stephen Williams.<
It was his undoing _ for the tattooed Williams, himself a sex offender, was
appalled by what he had heard, and told police.<
Smith told Williams that he had bound Amanda Walker, wrapped her in polythene
and cut her with a knife before and after having sex with her, then left her
mutilated body in a shallow leafy grave at Wisley.<
The martial arts expert, who knew the points to put pressure on the body in
order to inflict pain _ and kill _ said he had put his hand on her nose and
mouth. That was when she died.<
According to detectives, he showed no remorse _ and rehearsed a story to tell
police, believing he could get away with murder.<
Faced with forensic evidence linking him by DNA to Amanda Walker's blood,
Smith made up a story, saying he had met her, but had left her alive.<
He claimed he had felt randy and in need of ``a bit of fun'' after leaving an
adults-only party in Ilford, Essex. He had not had sex there - but had paid #80
to go into their steam room with a hostess. Also on the premises was a dungeon
and ``film star room''.<
When he left, he had gone to search out a prostitute in Paddington on his way
home to Hampton, west London.<
In Paddington he encountered 21-year-old Miss Walker, who was from a
respectable family in Swarcliffe, Leeds, and had a two-year-old son, who lived
with his natural father in Yorkshire.<
She had moved to London with a boyfriend in search of a fresh life. But she
became an occasional drug-user _ and had turned to prostitution only four weeks
before she died.<
She was not streetwise in the world of prostitution.<
Tragically, members of her family had almost succeeded in persuading her to
forsake her new life and return north. But as they took her back to London to
collect her clothes, she got out of the car and disappeared back on to the
streets.<
That same evening, she was arrested for soliciting and bailed by police. A few
hours later she was with her last customer _ Smith.<
When he was 20, Smith was convicted of raping a young mother in front of her
two children. He served four years.<
On his release, while working as an unlicensed minicab driver, he attacked a
woman passenger after locking all the car doors. She managed to escape by
kicking in the windscreen.<
Smith was charged with unlawful imprisonment and received a suspended
sentence.<
He was later charged with attempting to rape and stab a prostitute in a hotel
room with a craft knife. But the woman failed to turn up at his trial to give
evidence.<
In July 1993, Smith was on trial again _ this time accused of murdering Miss
Crump.<
Smith admitted that he had had sex with Miss Crump, but denied killing her.
The jury cleared him.<
His counsel had claimed in court that the detective in charge of the case
``did not know what she was doing'' and, with an older male detective, had
constructed a case which was ``all invention''.<
