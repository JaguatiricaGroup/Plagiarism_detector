SEX KILLER JAILED FOR LIFE<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
A convicted sex attacker - cleared of killing and mutilating a vice girl six
years ago - was jailed for life at the Old Bailey today for an almost carbon
copy murder.<
David Smith, 43, a lorry driver from Hampton, west London, was convicted by an
eight man - four women jury of the Ripper-style killing of 21-year-old
prostitute Amanda Walker at a Surrey beauty spot in April this year.<
The Recorder of London, Judge Michael Hyam told an emotionless Smith: ``Anyone
who has heard what you did to that unfortunate young woman must have been
horrified and revolted by what you did to her after you killed her.<
``It is evident you killed her to satisfy your perverted sexual obsession. You
are without pity or remorse.''<
The judge added Smith was ``extremely dangerous to women and are likely to
remain so''.<
Smith had denied murdering Miss Walker.<
As the sadistic, powerfully-built killer was led to cells it was learned that
police may now interview him about other unsolved attacks on women all over the
country.<
Smith's details - together with those of Miss Walker's murder - have been
circulated to all UK forces.<
Some have already shown interest - but police are not giving details.<
