  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miss Walker was brutally murdered, said the judge.<
Her maggot-ridden body was found in a shallow leafy grave near the Royal
Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley in Surrey nearly six weeks after she
disappeared.<
It was a spot renowned for sex romps and orgies.<
Miss Walker ``almost certainly'' was killed there by Smith, a martial arts
expert - nicknamed ``Lurch'' by workmates because of his size and speech. He
frequented the Wisley woodlands as a voyeur - watching others making love.<
Smith had picked up Miss Walker after attending a commercially organised
``party for broad-minded adults'' in Ilford, Essex, Mr William Boyce,
prosecuting had told the jury.<
When he left ``he felt randy and was looking for a bit of fun'', the court
heard.<
He went to Paddington seeking out a prostitute. Here, Miss Walker - a newcomer
to streetlife - crossed his path.<
Smith had sex with her, killed her and later dumped her blood stained clothing
on a footpath a mile from his home, Mr Boyce told the court.<
Her body was found by a RHS employee at Wisley - covered with leaves and
branches - nearly six weeks later.<
``He noticed a pungent smell and initially thought it might be a dead deer but
saw it was a decomposing body,'' Mr Boyce said.<
Smith had already been arrested - after police trawled known sex offenders in
the area where Miss Walker's clothes were found earlier. His DNA matched blood
found on her clothing.<
