  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smith had been convicted of raping one woman and falsely imprisoning another in
the past.<
But in 1993, he was cleared at the Old Bailey of murdering 33-year-old
call-girl Sarah Crump after his defence counsel accused police in court of
suppressing evidence and incompetence. Smith had thanked the jury as he left
court.<
Police emphatically denied the defence allegation. They closed the case -
saying they were not looking for anyone else in connection with it.<
At the time, Smith had admitted paying Miss Crump for sex on the night she
died. But he denied he murdered her.<
Miss Crump, originally from Lincoln, led a double life, working by day as a
psychiatric nurse and at night for an escort agency.<
Her body was found in her Southall, west London, home in August, 1991,
infested with insects.<
She had been knifed and her dead, or dying body had been ``dreadfully
mutilated''.<
While in prison awaiting trial accused of Amanda Walker's murder, Smith
boasted of murdering Miss Walker to his cell-mate, Stephen Williams.<
It was his undoing - for the tattooed Williams, himself a sex offender, was
appalled by what he had heard, and told police.<
Smith told Williams that he had bound Amanda Walker, wrapped her in polythene
and cut her with a knife ``downstairs'' before and after having sex with her.<
The martial arts expert, who knew the points to put pressure on the body in
order to inflict pain - and kill - said he had put his hand on her nose and
mouth. That was when she died.<
According to detectives, he showed no remorse - and rehearsed a story to tell
police, believing he could get away with murder.<
Faced with forensic evidence linking him by DNA to Amanda Walker's blood,
Smith made up a story, saying he had met her, but had left her alive.<
Miss Walker, was from a respectable family in Swarcliffe, Leeds, who had been
trying to get her to give up her street life.<
Her relatives did not attend Smith's trial.<
