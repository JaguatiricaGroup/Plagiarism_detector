The jailing of Smith was welcomed by detectives.<
Outside court, Dertective Chief Inspector Norman McKinlay said: ``I am
obviously very pleased the jury has returned a guilty verdict.<

horribly mutilated and dumped in woodland.<
``David Smith is a dangerous man with a history of violence towards women. I
am pleased he will remain behind bars for a long time.<
``My thoughts, and the thoughts of other officers in the case, are with Amanda
Walker's family together with Sarah Crump's family.<
``The past seven months have been extremely distressing and difficult for
them,'' added the detective.<
