POLICE CHIEF DENIES SEX ASSAULT CHARGES<
By Melvyn Howe, PA News<
One of Britain's most senior police officers today pleaded not guilty to
indecently assaulting two women.<
Surrey Deputy Chief Constable Ian Beckett, 53, is alleged to have attacked
them nearly a year ago.<
During a six-minute plea and directions hearing at London's Southwark Crown
Court, he denied assaulting both women on December 14, committing a third
offence nearly a week later and a fourth on Christmas Eve.<
Agreeing to continue his unconditional bail, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, told
Beckett of Chertsey, Surrey, that his two-week trial would start on March 27
next year.<
Beckett, who has been a policeman for 33 years, was a chief inspector in the
Metropolitan Police until he moved to Surrey as assistant chief constable in
1991.<
He was promoted to his present post as second in command of the
Guildford-based 1,600-strong force in 1994, and two years ago was awarded the
Queen's Police Medal.<
