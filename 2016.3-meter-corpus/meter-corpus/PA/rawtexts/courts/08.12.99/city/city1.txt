PROTESTOR CLEARED OF CITY VIOLENCE CHARGE<
By Melvyn Howe, PA News<
A peaceful ``Reclaim the Streets'' protester, swept along by a violent mob
storming a top City trading centre, was today cleared of violent disorder.<
Anthony Jones was photographed at the head of the crowd, allegedly about to
throw a punch, as ``terrified'' staff at the London International Financial
Futures Exchange battled to keep them at bay.<
The 35-year-old welder was arrested the next day after a police officer
recognised his picture in The Daily Telegraph.<
However, Jones, of no fixed address, told London's Southwark Crown Court that
he was forced into the foyer of the building and then on to an escalator by the
sheer weight of the crowd entering the place.<
He denied trying to punch anybody and insisted he had simply been attempting
to protect himself.<
During his three-day trial, the jury of five men and seven women heard how a
six-strong masked ``anarchic commander force'', armed with scaffolding poles and
iron bars, smashed through the bomb-proofed glass doors of the Liffe building
before ransacking the foyer and causing #1.4 million worth of damage.<
