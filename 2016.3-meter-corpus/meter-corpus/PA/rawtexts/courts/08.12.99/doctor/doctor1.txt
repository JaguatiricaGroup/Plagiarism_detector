MURDER TRIAL GP DENIES STOCKPILING MORPHINE<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
Doctor Harold Shipman denied at his murder trial today that he had stockpiled
drugs, but said he could not say what happened to morphine he prescribed to one
of his terminally ill patients.<
Shipman, who denies murdering 15 women patients and forging the will of one of
them, said that he prescribed diamorphine to patient Frank Crompton even though
he was not yet in pain.<
He told prosecuting counsel Richard Henriques QC at Preston Crown that he
prescribed 10 100mg ampoules of the drug in February 1995, but that Mr Crompton
cashed in the prescription and then destroyed the drugs.<
Shipman said he then prescribed a further 10 ampoules the following month
which were collected from the chemist, but he had no idea what happened to
them.<
Mr Henriques said there was no evidence that the drug was ever administered to
Mr Crompton, who was suffering from cancer, because his treatment did not
require a syringe driver.<
Shipman, 53, of Roe Cross Green, Mottram, Greater Manchester, agreed that at
the time Mr Crompton was not in great pain but that he had given him the
prescription so that he would be ready for when the pain began.<
Mr Henriques said: ``All that diamorphine was part of your stockpiling.''<
Shipman replied: ``It was not part of anybody's stockpiling. I was not
stockpiling any drugs.''<
