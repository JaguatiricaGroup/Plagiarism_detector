SHIPMAN ACCUSED OF FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS TO ENSURE CREMATIONS<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
Harold Shipman was today accused of falsifying documents to ensure that two of
his alleged victims were cremated.<
Prosecuting counsel Mr Richard Henriques QC told the jury at Preston Crown
Court that Shipman deliberately tried to deceive the registrar responsible for
authorising cremations.<
In the case of Marie West, 81, Mr Henriques said Shipman recorded that both he
and a friend were present at time of death because the cremation was ``more
likely to be granted if two people were present at the time of death.''<
He also said that for the same reason Shipman recorded on the cremation
certificate of Lizzie Adams, 77, that he was given information about her death
from her friend Bill Catlow, when the Crown allege he was not.<
Mrs Adams, of Coronation Avenue, Hyde, died while Shipman was making a home
visit, the court heard.  <
He was found in the front room of Mrs Adams' home looking at the Royal Doulton
by her dancing partner Bill Catlow.<
Mr Catlow told Shipman he felt a pulse but, giving evidence for the tenth day,
Shipman said: ``I said to him he was feeling his own pulse. He was feeling a
wrist, not a place to feel a pulse, not when patient is ill.'' <
Shipman also disagreed with the evidence of three witnesses who said that
Shipman had told them he had called an ambulance.<
He also said he offered the family an opportunity to have a post mortem
examination carried out and denied that he had been ``intimidating'' or had
``browbeaten'' the family to avoid one.<
On the 35th day of the trial Mr Henriques pointed out that Mrs Adams had died
on February 28, 1997 - but Shipman had recorded on his computer that she had
died on March 1.<
He said: ``The appearance to the outside world or anyone checking up on your
activities is that you had arranged to admit her to hospital the day before she
died.''<
Shipman denied this and said he had not had time to update his records on the
day of death and his computer had entered the date when the entry was created.<
Mr Henriques said the case of Mrs Adams was very similar to that of Mrs West,
who died at her home on Knott Fold, Hyde, while Shipman was visiting her.<
The court heard that she had died while her friend Marion Hadfield had gone
upstairs to the bathroom on March 6, 1995.<
A week before her death Shipman prescribed ten 100 milligram ampoules of
diamorphine to another patient. But Mr Henriques said there was no record of the
drug being administered.<
Mr Henriques accused him of ``stockpiling'' a supply of the drug. Shipman
replied: ``It was not part of anybody's stockpiling.''  <
Shipman, 53, of Roe Cross Green, Hyde, denies murdering 15 of his female
patients and of forging the will of one of them.<
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.<
