Alleged victim Marie West, 81, died at her home at Knott Fold, Hyde, while
Shipman was visiting her.<
The court heard that when she died her friend Marian Hadfield had gone
upstairs to the toilet and returned to hear Shipman talking with Mrs West.<
Shipman then walked into the kitchen and, surprised to see Mrs Hadfield, told
her he was looking for Mrs West's son Christopher.<
Mr Henriques said: ``The version of facts you have just run through is a
complete fabrication and totally at odds with the version you gave to
Christopher West.''<
Mr Henriques said that Shipman told Mr West that his mother had died while he
had gone to the car to collect his bag.<
Shipman said: ``I didn't leave the house until Mrs West died. I took my bag in
with me, there was no reason not to.''<
Of Mr West he said: ``When I spoke to him he was extremely shocked I'm not
sure I was getting any information across to him.''<
Shipman said that he had offered Mr West a chance to discuss his mother's
death and a possible post mortem examination the following day.<
But Mr Henriques said that in Mr West's evidence he made no reference to a
post mortem examination ever being suggested.<
Mr Henriques pointed out that during Shipman's examination of Mrs West he got
a positive result from a reflex test but did not choose to call an ambulance or
try to resuscitate her.<
He said: ``Are you going to tell us it was not worth resuscitation?''<
Shipman: ``The effort put into resuscitating her would not have given any
results''.<
The jury heard that Shipman had written on Mrs West's cremation form that she
had been a patient for 18 months but the medical records show she had attended
the surgery since October 1992, three years before her death.<
Mr Henriques pointed out that as Shipman had recorded the time it had taken
Mrs West to die as being 20 minutes there were at least 10 minutes that he could
have called for an ambulance.<
He also said that Shipman recorded Mrs Hadfield as being present at the time
of death when in fact she was in the next room.<
Shipman replied: ``You are interpreting this as who were present at death as
being who was standing around the body.''<
Mr Henriques suggested that Shipman recorded two people as being present so
that Mrs West's death was not queried and the cremation could take place.<
When discussing the cause of death Shipman said: ``There's no doubt in my mind
that that lady had a sudden lethal stroke.''<
Mr Henriques said: ``Or a sudden lethal dose of diamorphine.''<
He added: ``This was the plainest possible case of a sudden death of which
only you could no the cause.''<
