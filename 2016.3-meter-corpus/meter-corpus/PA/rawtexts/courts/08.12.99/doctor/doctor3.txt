  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
(corrected repetition _ amending spelling in third par to ``Doulton'')<
The next patient Shipman denied murdering was 77-year-old Lizzie Adams who
also died while the doctor was making a home visit.<
Mrs Adams, of Coronation Avenue, had telephoned the surgery giving the
impression she was not seriously ill on February 28, 1997, the day she died.<
The prosecution allege that Shipman gave her a lethal dose of morphine, then
was caught looking at her Royal Doulton figurines while he was waiting for her
to die, the court heard.<
During his 10th day in the witness box, Shipman denied that the friend who
found him at Mrs Adams's house had felt a pulse.<
``I said to him he was feeling his own pulse. He was feeling a wrist, not a
place to feel a pulse, not when a patient is ill.''<
Shipman also disagreed with the evidence of three witnesses who said Shipman
had told them he had called an ambulance to Mrs Adams.<
He said he had offered the family an opportunity to have a post-mortem
examination and denied ``intimidating'' or ``brow-beating'' in order to avoid
having one.<
The court was told Shipman put the wrong date of death on Mrs Adams's medical
records. <
Mr Henriques said this was ``part of creating a false medical history''.<
He said Shipman wanted it to look as if he had arranged for Mrs Adams to be
admitted to hospital one day and that she had died the following day.<
Mr Henriques claimed Shipman had tried to mislead those responsible for the
cremation by saying a neighbour had given him information relating to Mrs
Adams's death.<
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.<
