`KEBAB SHOP SOCCER STAR OBSTRUCTED POLICE' COURT TOLD<
By Michael Bristow, PA News<
Blackburn Rovers striker Nathan Blake obstructed a police officer after a
friend was ``racially abused'' in a kebab shop, a court heard today.<
The Welsh international is also charged with causing harassment during a night
out days before a Euro 2000 qualifying match with Switzerland.<
Blake is charged along with his friend Anthony Chambers, who was told to ``go
back to where you come from, you wog'' at the Oasis Kebab Shop in Newport, south
Wales, the court heard.<
Blake, 27, pleaded not guilty to both charges at the Newport Magistrates Court
trial today. Chambers, 33, pleaded not guilty to a charge of causing
harassment.<
The court heard the defendants got into an argument in the kebab shop in the
early hours of one morning in March this year when Chambers walked to the front
of the queue. <
Prosecutor Richard Edwards said an annoyed Chambers, a hairdresser of
Commercial Road, Newport, was arrested after using abusive language inside the
take-away.<
Blake, of Chepstow Road, Newport was arrested after he tried to intervene in
the arrest, Mr Edwards said. The footballer was also using bad language, the
court heard. <
In evidence Pc Gareth Jones said Chambers had told him the reason he was upset
was because he had been racially taunted and told to ``go back to where you come
from, you wog''.<
Sergeant Mark Smith said he arrested Blake after warning the footballer not to
intervene in the arrest of his friend and about his bad language.<
He told the court he finally decided to arrest Blake when he shouted towards
officers ``you lot are a f****** joke'' as the police were leading Chambers
away.<
Blake, originally from South Wales, played for Cardiff City before moving to
Bolton Wanderers and then on to Division One side Blackburn Rovers for #4.5
million.<
Wales lost the Euro 2000 match in Zurich  2-0 a few days after Blake's
arrest.<
