Afterwards, the two men's solicitor David Miller said: ``In the wake of the
Stephen Lawrence case, Mr Blake and Mr Chambers were extremely concerned that Mr
Chambers having been the victim of a racially motivated assault and public order
offence, that it's they, the two black men, who have been prosecuted for their
purely verbal responses of upset and indignation.''<
He went on to say the defendants were also concerned that ``those responsible
for the more serious racist incident immediately proceeding this have never been
brought to justice''.<
The lawyer added: ``Mr Blake and Mr Chambers are, however, grateful that at
last justice in their case has been done.''<
During the one-day trial, Blake referred to the everyday racial incidents
which he had to endure. <
He told the court: ``I would rather someone spit in my face than call me black
this, nigger that.''<
Asked how he knew his friend would be arrested, he said: ``I am a black man
and he is a black man and in society we are outnumbered.<
``I knew for a fact that officer wanted to arrest Junior (Chambers). I could
see it in his face.''<
The court heard the incident which lead to the two arrests took place at the
Oasis kebab shop, in Newport, South Wales, in the early hours of one morning in
March this year.<
Blake, Chambers and their friends had been out drinking to a pub and
night-club in the town before stopping off at the kebab shop on their way home.<
The footballer was due to train later that day for Wales' Euro2000 qualifying
match in Zurich, Switzerland. They lost the match 2-0.<
At the kebab shop, Chambers got into an argument with two women when he tried
to order food without queuing up, the court heard.<
Giving evidence, Pc Gareth Jones said Chambers had told him he had become
agitated after being racially taunted by the women who told him to ``go back to
where you come from, you wog''.<
``I was really upset, that's why I was cursing. I come from Pill in Newport,''
said the 33-year-old Chambers, of Commercial Road, Newport.<
The argument continued and eventually Chambers was arrested.<
Blake, of Chepstow Road, Newport, was also arrested after he put his arm
between Chambers and an officer to try to prevent his friend from being
arrested.<
``My intention was to calm Junior down. Let's forget it, get a taxi and go,''
he told the court.<
