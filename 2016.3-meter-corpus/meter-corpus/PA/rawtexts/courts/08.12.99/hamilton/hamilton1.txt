GIFTS WERE UNSOLICITED, SAYS HAMILTON<
By Cathy Gordon and Jan Colley, PA News<
Neil Hamilton told the High Court ``cash for questions'' libel trial today how
he was given ``unsolicited'' gifts _ such as Christmas hampers, ties and teddy
bears _ by Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed.<
Mr Hamilton said: ``He used to give out frequently things like teddy bears,
ties and bottles of whisky and so on, and I would have had several gifts of that
kind which he would press on you if you visited him in his office.''<
The former Tory minister, who was giving evidence on the 15th day of his
action against the Harrods chief, said Mr Al Fayed twice gave him Christmas
hampers worth about #100.<
His counsel, Mr Desmond Browne QC, asked him: ``Did you regard these
unsolicited gifts as in any way related to your parliamentary activities?''<
Mr Hamilton, 50, of The Old Rectory, Nether Alderley, Macclesfield, Cheshire,
told the jury and Mr Justice Morland at London's Law Courts: ``No, not at all.<
``All members of parliament receive unsolicited gifts of a relatively modest
nature at Christmas as indeed do people in many walks of life, particularly in
the business world.''<
Mr Hamilton is suing Mr Al Fayed over allegations that he had corruptly
demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the
Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods.<
Mr Al Fayed made the allegations in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme in
January 1997.<
Mr Hamilton began giving his evidence yesterday, when he described Mr Al
Fayed's allegations as a ``pack of lies''.<
The Harrods owner denies libel and pleads justification.<
Mr Hamilton, the former MP for Tatton, who lost his seat in the 1997 general
election, said he had given Mr Al Fayed gifts in return at Christmas and at
other times.<
He said he gave him a House of Commons coffee service _ to thank him for his
hospitality at the Paris Ritz _ and also gave him ``things like House of Commons
whisky, House of Commons brandy and I once gave him a pair of House of Commons
portcullis cuff links and various things of that kind''.<
Mr Hamilton said Mr Al Fayed had seemed pleased to receive the cuff links at
the time, but was later ``disparaging about them because they weren't good
enough for him''.<
A box of identical nine-carat cuff links was handed to Mr Hamilton in the
witness box for his inspection.<
To laughter in the packed Court 13, both Mr Al Fayed's counsel, Mr George
Carman QC, and the jury declined the opportunity to see them.<
Mr Hamilton said he and his wife Christine had also been very keen to
entertain Mr Al Fayed and had invited him to dinner, but he never took them up
on their offer.<
