HAMILTON ABANDONS SHADOW CABINET JOB CLAIM<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Neil Hamilton today abandoned his claim that he could have been in the shadow
cabinet were it not for the ``pack of lies'' told by Mohamed Al Fayed over the
cash for questions affair.<
The one-time minister for corporate affairs made his dramatic climbdown just
minutes into his cross-examination by George Carman QC, for the Harrods boss.<
Mr Carman asked if the former Tatton MP was seriously asking for damages for
his lost parliamentary career in the light of the critical findings of a 1997
select committee on standards and privileges.<
The committee had found that the list of interests which Mr Hamilton had not
registered ``adds up to a casualness bordering on indifference or contempt
towards the rules of the House on disclosure of interests''.<
It also said that his conduct ``fell seriously and persistently below'' the
standards which the House was entitled to expect of its members.<
The committee had concluded that, had Mr Hamilton still been a member of the
House _ he had lost his seat in the General Election _ it would have recommended
a ``substantial period of suspension''.    <
Mr Carman said: ``Are you seriously saying that, in the light of those grave
findings against you by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1997, that
if you had the great fortune ever to be returned to Tatton or any other
constituency in this country, you would have a realistic prospect of serving in
the shadow cabinet on the front bench now?''<
Watched by his wife, Christine, and by Mr Al Fayed, Mr Hamilton replied:
``Well, Mr Mandelson is back in the Cabinet.''<
Mr Carman went on: ``And since when did a select committee make findings that
he would be suspended?''<
Mr Hamilton said: ``Well, he was subject to a very great deal of criticism.''<
He went on to tell Mr Carman that ``with respect'' they were not in court to
consider the findings of the select committee but to debate the ``extremely
grave'' allegations which Mr Al Fayed had made.<
He said that the jury would be in the best position to decide the facts as the
procedures of the courtroom meant that there would be a ``fair trial''.<
As Mr Carman asked Mr Hamilton to leave the speeches to his counsel, Mr
Hamilton said: ``It's my life that's in issue.''<
The QC repeated his question over whether Mr Hamilton was seriously asking the
jury to award him damages for the loss of career prospects, which included the
possibility that he would be serving as a front bench spokesman.<
Mr Hamilton said: ``I'm very happy to exclude from the damages any possibility
of being a front bench spokesman in the House of Commons.<
``I'm quite happy to abandon that specific point.''<
Mr Hamilton is suing Mr Al Fayed over allegations that he had corruptly
demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the
Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods.<
Mr Al Fayed, who made the allegations in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme in
January 1997, denies libel and has pleaded justification.<
