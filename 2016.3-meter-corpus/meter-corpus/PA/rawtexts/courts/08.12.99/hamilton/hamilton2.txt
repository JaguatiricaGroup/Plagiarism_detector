Mr Hamilton said that he did not enter his September 1987 stay at The Ritz on
the register of members' interests because it did not seem to him, on the rules
as they then stood, to be a registerable interest.<
``No-one else, to my knowledge, had registered hospitality of that kind and
there had been several invitees who been invited to Paris and were flown out and
they didn't register that either.<
``I'm not suggesting anything sinister but these rules are not clear cut and
members have to interpret them for themselves...<
``Although members were not any less punctilious about their duties, they
approached these questions in a less censorious and searching way.''<
He denied that he was trying to keep the trip secret.<
``We were very excited by the experience and told all sorts of people about it
and showed them the photos of our visit to the villa to all sorts of people in
the House of Commons.''<
Mr Hamilton said that he would have registered the stay if it was in a hotel
which Mr Al Fayed had not owned because then the Harrods boss would have been
paying out to a third party.<
He would also have registered trips abroad which were funded by organisations
based abroad.<
But, at the time, there was no specific category for hospitality on the form
sent to MPs to register their interests.<
And there was no code of conduct or explanatory guidance available.<
He said that he had understood from Mr Al Fayed that the visit to The Ritz
involved staying in what was effectively his private residence, which was also
run as a commercial enterprise.<
The trip was investigated by the Select Committee on Members' Interests and he
accepted its verdict that the stay should have been registered.<
Asked by Mr Browne if he had regarded The Ritz hospitality as linked to his
parliamentary activities, Mr Hamilton said: ``Well no, not at all.''<
``The invitation arose over a discussion about what we were both doing for the
summer holidays and it was the Windsor villa that was the catalyst for it to
take place.<
``That was what he was particularly keen to show me and I was keen to see.<
``The Ritz invitation - although extremely welcome obviously - was the
secondary aspect to it.''<
Asked if he had considered that the trip might be thought to affect his
actions or speeches in Parliament, Mr Hamilton said that he did not at the time
but, with hindsight, realised that he had made an ``error of judgment''.<
``But I was far from alone in interpreting the rules in this way, so it wasn't
a deliberate attempt to conceal or to pull the wool over the eyes of my
parliamentary colleagues.''<
