  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Carman and Mr Hamilton locked horns from the very beginning of the
inquisition, which is likely to last more than two days.<
Counsel: ``You served in parliament for 14 years from 1983 to 1997. Is that
right?''<
Mr Hamilton: ``Yes, I was elected in June 1983 and ceased to be MP when the
1997 parliament expired in April...''<
Mr Carman: ``The answer to my question is yes.''<
Mr Hamilton: ``The answer is the one I gave you.''<
Mr Carman: ``An MP has certain basic duties and obligations. Would you accept
that?''<
Mr Hamilton: ``True. Yes, I would.''<
Mr Carman said that an MP had to serve his constituency and country loyally
and had to be truthful in the House of Commons at all times.<
Mr Hamilton said that he agreed to all of these.<
Mr Carman then asked, if one was serving as a junior minister, one owed a duty
to show candour at all times to the Prime Minister, the Cabinet Secretary, the
Chief Whip and one's principal Secretary of State.<
Mr Hamilton: ``So far as possible, it's true.''<
Asked what he meant, Mr Hamilton said that in public life ``people do not tell
everything there is to be known at all times about every issue''.<
``Any more than in making your opening speech in these proceedings, you felt
it necessary to tell the whole truth about me rather than the half truths that
you uttered.''<
Mr Carman asked if Mr Hamilton had found in his 14 years in Parliament, or
when he was a junior minister, ``any impediment'' to being candid with those
four leading figures.<
Mr Hamilton: ``I'm quite prepared to explore any particular example where you
think I might have behaved to the contrary.''<
Mr Carman: ``If you can't answer the question, say so.''<
Mr Hamilton repeated that he was quite prepared to meet ``head-on'' any
allegations Mr Carman might put to him.<
Asked if, as minister of corporate affairs, he had ever found himself in a
position where he couldn't tell the truth to the House of Commons, Mr Hamilton
said: ``I can't think of one.''<
Asked if his claim for damages from the jury reflected his lost opportunity
for a parliamentary career and a career outside in commerce or the city, Mr
Hamilton said: ``Yes, what has happened to me has been devastating.''<
Mr Hamilton said that he had respect for the views of a parliamentary select
committee but that he wouldn't necessarily agree with them.<
He added: ``I don't accept, of course, the conclusions of this committee which
is why we are in court today.''<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
end
