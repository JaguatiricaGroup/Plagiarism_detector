Later, Mr Browne turned to the issue of commission payments Mr Hamilton received
for the introduction of companies to political lobbyist, Ian Greer Associates.<
The first concerned the National Nuclear Corporation, for which he received a
#4,000 commission payment from Ian Greer in 1987.<
Mr Hamilton said that after Mr Greer had signed a contract with the company,
he had contacted him, thanked him for putting his name before NNC and said it
was his usual practice to offer an introduction payment.<
Mr Hamilton said he later became a consultant to NNC at a fee of #7,500 a
year.<
The one-year contract was not renewed as the company was privatised and had no
further need for the sort of services he was giving.<
The consultancy was registered on the register of MPs' interests, said Mr
Hamilton, adding: ``I registered it straight away.''<
The #4,000 would have been paid by cheque by Mr Greer, said Mr Hamilton, ``but
I regarded this as a very welcome windfall and I didn't particularly desire to
hand over half of it to the Inland Revenue''.<
He said he asked Mr Greer, whom he knew well, if he could help him reduce the
tax liability ``perfectly lawfully'' by ``defraying the bills which I might run
up over the course of the next few months'' instead of giving him a cheque for
the whole amount.<
Pursuant to what he had agreed with Mr Greer, he said, he bought antiques and
goods from a department store.<
These goods, and air fares to the United States for himself and his wife
costing #1,594, were paid for by Mr Greer.<
Mr Hamilton said the total cost of those items left a balance of #746 from the
original agreed commission of #4,000. This balance was eventually paid to him by
cheque.<
In 1988 Mr Greer paid him #6,000 commission in connection with US Tobacco. The
payment was made by cheque, Mr Hamilton said.<
After the Guardian ``cash for questions'' story broke on October 20 1994, ``it
was absolute bedlam'', the former MP told the jury.<
``We were besieged by journalists and television crews and the whole world
went absolutely mad, so it seemed to me at the time.''<
On the day after publication he was opening an extension of a school in his
constituency when he received a telephone call from Michael Heseltine, who had
been out of the country the day before.<
He said they discussed the allegations that had been made against him.<
Mr Hamilton said he had never performed any parliamentary services for Mr
Greer for payment or in the expectation of payment.<
He said he resigned from his ministerial post on October 25, 1994, after
attending what was, so to speak, ``a hanging committee''.<
Those at the meeting were deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, chief whip
Richard Ryder and cabinet secretary Sir Robin Butler.<
Mr Hamilton said: ``The decision had obviously been taken, even before I
arrived at the meeting, that my position was untenable.''<
He said that this was not because they believed the allegations against him
but because the accumulating pressure of the developing story made it too much
of a distraction both for himself as a minister and the government as a whole.<
He said he issued libel proceedings against The Guardian within hours of the
``cash for questions'' allegations being made.<
He had ``no choice'' but to discontinue his action because it was not
practical financially to continue after his legal team withdrew because of a
perceived conflict of interest in jointly representing himself and Mr Greer.<
