  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turning to the allegation that he had ``corruptly'' taken a #10,000 payment from
Mobil, Mr Hamilton said that in April 1989 he was approached on the company's
behalf by leading tax QC, Peter Whiteman, to promote a proposed amendment to the
Finance Bill.<
He advised Mr Whiteman that the chance of success was remote but agreed to
raise the issue.<
Mr Hamilton said that there was no doubt in his mind, from the meeting, about
the proposal Mr Whiteman was going to make to Mobil.<
``It was that I should be retained in a consultancy capacity to assist, not
just in the promotion of the amendment, but to help organise a business
lobby.''<
Mr Whiteman's letter to him - to the effect that he had strongly recommended
Mobil to ``retain'' Mr Hamilton - reinforced this view.<
``There is no way I could be retained by Mobil as an MP or indeed in any other
capacity unless there was an inference that I was going to be paid for what I
was doing.<
``I'm obviously prepared to help all sorts of people but that's a totally
different concept from retention.''<
He said he would plainly not have wanted payment if he had just been promoting
an amendment, as that would have been contrary to the rules on bribery.<
``The arrangement which was in essence evolving was obviously going to go way
beyond that - of a non-parliamentary nature, indeed a legal nature.''<
Mr Hamilton said: ``I had been under the illusion all along that they had
wanted me to be a consultant. I was trying to perform the functions of a
consultant and I was puzzled as to why the ideas I was putting out were dropping
into a black hole.''<
