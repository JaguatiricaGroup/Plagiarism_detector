  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Hamilton said that he telephoned Mr Whiteman in August/September 1989 to
clarify the unresolved question of the consultancy fee, although he was sure
that he did not ask what Mobil's payment terms were.<
Asked how Mr Whiteman reacted to his enquiry, Mr Hamilton said that the QC was
``very matter-of-fact'' about it and said he would make inquiries.<
He said that there was no indication of embarrassment whatsoever.<
``If there had been of course I would have wondered why he was being
embarrassed as there was certainly no reason for him to be embarrassed on the
basis of our previous discussions.''<
Mr Hamilton said that Mr Whiteman rang back shortly afterwards and said that
Mobil were proposing a fee of #10,000 and would that be all right.<
``I had mentioned no figure at all. Of course I was absolutely delighted
because it was a lot more than I was expecting and was greater than the other
consultancy fees I had had - by, in some cases, a fair margin.''<
He sent his invoice to Mobil in early September 1989 and registered the
consultancy on the list of members' interests in November 1989.<
``I suppose strictly speaking I ought to have registered it earlier but in
those days people weren't so punctilious about registering an interest within
the four-week period and in the immediate aftermath of the avalanche which fell
on me in October 1994 there was a sudden rush of MPs to register interests
late.''<
Mr Hamilton said any embarrassment or shock on the part of Mobil had never
been communicated to him. ``I had nothing but courteous letters and courteous
conversations with people at Mobil.''<
