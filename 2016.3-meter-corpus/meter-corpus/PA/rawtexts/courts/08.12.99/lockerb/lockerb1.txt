JUDGE MAY RULE ON CONSPIRACY CHARGE BID<
Lockerbie judge Lord Sutherland may rule today on a defence bid to drop
conspiracy from the charges faced by the two Libyans accused of murdering the
270 air crash victims.<
If he upholds the defence argument, this could amount to a severe setback to
the Crown by limiting the evidence that prosecutors can call on the separate
charge of murder, legal observers have speculated.<
Other legal issues remain to be argued today at the Scottish High Court
procedural hearing at Camp Zeist in Holland where the two accused men are
appearing for the first time in public.<
Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, 47, and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 43, face
charges of alternative charges of conspiracy, murder, and a breach of the 1982
Aviation Security Act.<
William Taylor QC, for Megrahi, told Lord Sutherland yesterday: ``The
submission I make is plump and plain.<
``Charge One is a charge of conspiracy used by the Crown as a device to
introduce into evidence matters that would not be competent to introduce were
the crime properly a crime of murder.''<
The defence, which claims that the conspiracy and murder charges are not
genuine alternative charges, has launched a four-pronged attack.<
:: The conspiracy charge is ``incompetent'' as the alleged plot is not triable
by a Scottish court.<
:: Even if it was a competent charge, it would not be triable if the accused
were cleared of murder.<
:: The conspiracy charge contains allegations of both conspiracy and murder
within one charge, and is therefore invalid.<
:: And it is ``unfair and oppressive'' to charge conspiracy to murder and
murder as alternatives, where the murder is also alleged in the second charge.<
Scotland's Solicitor General, Colin Boyd QC, has argued that the conspiracy
charge is valid.<
And attacking one of the prongs of the defence argument, he said there may be
evidence of a possible Scottish link to the two accused men.<
``I am not suggesting the conspiracy was necessarily directed against Scotland
but rather it could be an inference that the explosion would occur at a time
when it (the plane) was over Scotland.''<
He said this inference could be drawn from certain facts ``which may or may
not'' be led by the Crown.<
Defending the Crown's indictment against another area of defence attack, Mr
Boyd said: ``The correct approach to take on Charge One is that there was a
conspiracy to destroy a civilian aircraft.<
``That conspiracy was continuing until the purpose had been achieved _ and its
purpose was achieved when the improvised explosive device exploded in
Scotland.''<
But Lord Sutherland, who will be one of three judges hearing the eventual
trial, questioned Mr Boyd closely over the inclusion of the allegation of murder
within the conspiracy charge.<
At one point the judge suggested this was a ``cumulative'' charge and asked Mr
Boyd: ``There are some (Scottish law) authorities that suggest that is not a
terribly good way of going about things?''<
The Solicitor General replied that the manner in which the charge was framed
was ``not one which was unusual in Scottish criminal procedure''.<
