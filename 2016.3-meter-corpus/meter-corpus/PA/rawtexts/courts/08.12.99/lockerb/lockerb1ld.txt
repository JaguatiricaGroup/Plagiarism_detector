WE MUST DISGUISE WITNESSES, PROSECUTION TELLS LOCKERBIE HEARING<
By Joe Quinn, PA News, in Zeist, Netherlands<
The date of the Lockerbie trial was today put back until May 3 next year after
the defence successfully sought more time to prepare its case.<
By next May, it will be more than a year since the two accused Libyan were
handed over by the Tripoli Government.<
The two men were flown to Kamp Zeist in Holland, where the legal proceedings
are taking place, in April this year.<
Granting the defence request to put back the date beyond the planned starting
date of February 2, the trial judge, Lord Sutherland, said: ``It is abundantly
clear from the nature of the indictment ... that preparation of the defence case
is one of exceptional difficulty.''<
A resumed procedural hearing will now take place on February 2.<
The two Libyans, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, 47, and Al Amin Khalifa
Fhimah, 43, are accused of conspiracy, murder, and a breach of the Aviation
Security Act.<
The charges follow the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 from Heathrow to New
York in the skies over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988. A
total of 270 people died.<
Earlier, the two men's defence team had launched a strong attack on a Crown
bid for the identities of some prosecution witnesses, including officers from
the United States' Central Intelligence Agency, to be disguised.<
Mr William Taylor QC asked: ``If a witness turns up wearing a Shirley Bassey
wig, with great amounts of make-up on their faces, contact lenses which change
the colour of the eyes, how am I to determine easily that a witness is credible,
reliable, and not being shifty?''<
The bid to protect witnesses was made by the Solicitor General for Scotland,
Mr Colin Boyd QC, at the pre-trial procedural hearing, which is being conducted
at Camp Zeist under Scottish legal procedures.<
Mr Boyd said some witnesses were members of the CIA.<
``There is a concern that if the identity of these officers was to be
revealed, the safety not only of the individual officers but their families and
those with whom they have contact could be put at very serious risk,'' he said.<
This was a matter of ``considerable concern'' to American authorities, which
had made an official request that the prosecution should make the application.<
The prosecution wanted that the individuals' ``true physical features'' should
be disguised. The witnesses should also give evidence while concealed from the
public, and recording and transmission of their voices beyond the well of the
court should be distorted.<
Closed circuit TV also should not function at any time while they testified,
Mr Boyd argued.<
``Disguise'' meant natural means, like dyeing hair or growing a beard, he told
the court, adding: ``It would not extend to any mask, or anything which would
mask the expressions of any individuals.''<
He said his bid applied in the case of the CIA officers and a number of former
officers of the Ministry of State Security in the former East Germany _ the
``Stazi''.<
The former Stazi members were ``in a different position'', Mr Boyd said,
adding: ``Were their true identities, physical expressions and voices to be
revealed, the Crown understands they and their families would be ostracised and
those in employment would run the very real risk of losing their employment.''<
He then went on to refer to a witness said to fall within the terms of the US
Federal Witness Protection Programme, whose safety and that of his family would
also be put at risk.<
``There are very real concerns about the safety of this witness'', said Mr
Boyd.<
He referred to Libyan TV coverage in Tripoli in 1993 of a rally at which
Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi was present.<
At that rally, individuals who claimed to be members of the witness's family
``denounced this particular individual'' and regarded his ``physical
liquidation'' as legitimate, said Mr Boyd.<
``That was broadcast in 1993 but the concern for his safety is still very real
and very present,'' he added.<
He made a similar request on behalf of an officer of the Swedish Intelligence
Service, saying that if the man's true identity, physical appearance and voice
were to be disclosed, his personal safety and that of his family would be at
risk.<
He also asked that a member of the British Security Services _ ``Mr A'' _
should also to be able to give his evidence in a way which would enable his true
identity and features to be concealed.<
Earlier today Lord Sutherland rejected defence arguments that a conspiracy
charge against the two Libyans should be dismissed because it was invalid.<
He ruled that the charge fell within Scottish jurisdiction and that it was
also valid in Scots law under other respects.<
But he granted the defence leave to appeal.<
