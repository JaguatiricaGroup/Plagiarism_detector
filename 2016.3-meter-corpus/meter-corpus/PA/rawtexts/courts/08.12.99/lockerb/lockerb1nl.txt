JUDGE RULES OUT DISGUISES FOR LOCKERBIE TRIAL WITNESSES<
By Joe Quinn, PA News<
Key prosecution witnesses at the Lockerbie trial, such as undercover CIA
officers, will not be able to use elaborate disguises like masks or wigs, a
judge warned today.<
Lord Sutherland, who will be one of three judges conducting the trial at Camp
Zeist in Holland, made this clear after defence lawyer William Taylor QC
launched a strong attack on a Crown attempt for some witnesses to be disguised.<
These include former East German Stasi security officers and a man whose
``liquidation'' was approved at a rally in Libya attended by Colonel Gaddafi.<
Seeking leave for the move, the Crown said it was not seeking permission for
masks but methods like the witnesses disguising their identities by growing
beards or dyeing their hair.<
But the defence launched a counter attack, raising the prospect of witnesses
wearing Shirley Bassey type wigs and heavy make-up.<
``It must be open to the defence to suggest that any particular individual is
a scoundrel who has been discredited by courts in his own country and whose
evidence has been treated with disdain in foreign courts,'' said Mr Taylor, for
one of the two accused Libyans.<
``It would be a travesty of justice and inevitably restrict the court's
examination of those individuals.<
``If a witness turns up in a Shirley Bassey wig wearing great amounts of
make-up on his face, contact lenses which change the colour of his eyes, how can
I determine easily whether the witness is credible, reliable, telling the truth,
and not being shifty or whether they blush when a particular question is
answered?''<
Lord Sutherland said there could be ``no question'' of a court giving approval
to a witness turning up in a mask, elaborate make-up, or wig to conceal their
features.<
``The court must have regard to the demeanour of a witness, including facial
expressions. Obviously if any witness chooses to grow a beard or moustache, grow
his hair long or shave his hair off, that is not something that is in the
control of the court.''<
The two-day, pre-trial procedural hearing at Camp Zeist was later adjourned to
February 2 _ the date that had been set for the full trial.<
The trial date was today put back to May 3 next year _ more than a year after
the handover of the two accused men under a United Nations-sponsored deal _ to
allow the defence more time to prepare for the complexities of a case in which
more than 1,000 witnesses could be called.<
The two men _ Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, 47, and Al Amin Khalifa
Fhimah, 43 _ face charges of conspiracy, murder and a breach of the 1982
Aviation Security Act over the Lockerbie disaster in which 270 died.<
A defence challenge to the conspiracy charge on legal grounds was today
rejected by Lord Taylor, although he granted leave to appeal.<
He ruled that the alleged conspiracy fell within the jurisdiction of a
Scottish court and that the charge was legally valid in other respects.<
He also rejected a defence argument that the two men's alleged membership of
the Libyan Intelligence Services should not appear in the indictment.<
For the two accused Libyans sitting impassively behind a glass screen at the
two-day hearing, which is the first time they have appeared in public since
their handover, today also marked the start of Ramadan _ the Muslim month in
which they can neither eat nor drink during daylight hours.<
