LOCKERBIE JUDGE RULES ON CONSPIRACY CHARGE<
By Joe Quinn, PA News, in Zeist, Netherlands<
Lockerbie trial judge Lord Sutherland today ruled that a conspiracy charge
against the two Libyans accused of bringing down the PanAm plane lies within the
jurisdiction of the Scottish courts.<
Ruling against the defence on the first point of a series of legal challenges
they have mounted against the conspiracy charge, he said: ``I am satisfied that
on the basis of what is set out in the charge of this indictment, that Scots
courts do have jurisdiction in this matter.''<
He then went on to deal with the other defence challenges to the conspiracy
charge.<
