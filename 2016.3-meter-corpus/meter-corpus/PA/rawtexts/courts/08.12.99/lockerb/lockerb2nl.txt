Launching his bid for the appearance of some prosecution witnesses to be
disguised, Colin Boyd QC, Solicitor General for Scotland, referred to the
contents of a legal document lodged in court by the Crown, but which officials
refused to circulate publicly.<
Referring first to a number of CIA officers he said: ``That agency is a US
Government agency which is engaged in the gathering and dissemination of
intelligence information.''<
The personal safety of individual officers, their families and associates
could be at risk if their identities were revealed, he said.<
The effectiveness of undercover operations could also be compromised, said Mr
Boyd, who told the court he had been specifically asked by the US authorities to
lodge his request relating to them.<
He proposed that the CIA officers be allowed to give evidence without
revealing their identities, with their ``true physical features'' disguised,
well concealed from the public, and with their voices distorted in any recording
or transmission that extended beyond the well of the court.<
Close circuit TV operators should be instructed not to film while they were
giving evidence and anyone referring to them should do so by the names under
which they were listed in the indictment.<
``We are talking about the lives of individuals, not just them but their
families and those who they come into contact with and we are talking about the
possible compromising of undercover operations which are of significance to a
friendly power,'' he said.<
Referring to other witnesses who were former officers of the East German Stasi
Ministry of State Security, he said they were in a different position.<
If their true identities, physical appearance and voices were revealed they
and their families could be ``ostracised'' and they could lose their jobs.<
``My understanding is these individuals are living in Germany under different
names and that friends, relatives and others are not aware of their past,'' said
Mr Boyd.<
He then referred to a witness called Abdul Majid Abdul Razkaz Abdul-Salam
Giaka, of whom he said: ``There are very real concerns about the personal safety
of this witness''.<
Mr Boyd said Libya TV had carried a report in 1993 of a rally in Tripoli where
Colonel Gaddafi was present.<
``In the course of that rally, individuals who claim to be members of this
witness's family denounce this particular individual and regarded his physical
liquidation as a legitimate right for the family first, and a sacred duty for
all the sons of the great Jamahirya in the defence of honour and dignity.<
``That was broadcast in 1993 but the concern for his safety is still very
real''.<
Mr Boyd said he did not object to any questions being put to that witness on
any financial funding he had received from the CIA or any other US or British
Government agency _ but to reveal his personal circumstances and whereabouts
would compromise his safety.<
Also included in the prosecution request were a Swedish intelligence officer
and a member of the British security services _ ``Mr A''.<
The request also included a Maltese woman national whom, Mr Boyd told the
court, acted as a translator when a ``Mr Majid'' was passing information to the
CIA in 1988 and 1989.<
``Again there are concerns for her safety and the safety of her family,'' he
said.<
