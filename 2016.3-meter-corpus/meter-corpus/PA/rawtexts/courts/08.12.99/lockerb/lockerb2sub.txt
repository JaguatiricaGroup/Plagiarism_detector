          10:08 08/12/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Lockerbie Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The defence had argued that a Scottish court had no jurisdiction over the
conspiracy charge as it alleged that a conspiracy took place in several
countries - but did not allege that it took place within Scotland.<
Lord Sutherland, who quoted several previous cases in delivering his legal
ruling, told the Scottish court sitting at Camp Zeist in Holland, made three
points:<
:: That a conspiracy was a ``continuing'' crime until it had run its course by
either being abandoned or until its purpose was completed.<
:: That if its purpose was to offend against the peace of this country, it was
triable in this country.<
:: ``Such an assumption of jurisdiction would not in any way offend against
international polity (CORRECT),'' said the judge.<
