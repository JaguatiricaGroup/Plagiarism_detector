The judge also rejected other defence challenges to the conspiracy charge.<
Referring to one legal challenge about the way the charge was framed, he said:
``The practice may be somewhat regrettable and may cause confusion to juries.<
``But I am satisfied it cannot be said to be incompetent in those
circumstances. I am not satisfied that the attack upon the relevance and
competence of charge one can succeed.''<
He also rejected a defence move to have deleted from the charges an allegation
that the two men were members of Libyan intelligence services.<
