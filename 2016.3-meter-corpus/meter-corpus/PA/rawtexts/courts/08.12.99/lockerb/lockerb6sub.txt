  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The two Libyans, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, 47, and Al Amin Khalifa
Fhimah, 43, are accused of conspiracy, murder, and a breach of the Aviation
Security Act.<
Launching his bid for the identities of some witnesses to be protected, the
Solicitor General said some were members of the CIA.<
``There is a concern that if the identity of these officers was to be
revealed, the safety not only of the individual officers but their families and
those with whom they have contact could be put at very serious risk,'' he said.<
Mr Boyd said this was a matter of ``considerable concern'' to US authorities
who had made an official request that the prosecution should seek this at the
procedural hearing.<
The prosecution wants their ``true physical features'' disguised, that they
should give evidence concealed from the public and that recording and
transmission of their voices beyond the well of the court should be distorted.<
Close circuit TV should not function at any time while they give evidence,
argued Mr Boyd.<
He told the court that disguise meant natural means, like dyeing hair or
growing a beard.<
``It would not extend to any mask, or anything which would mask the
expressions of any individuals,'' he assured the court.<
He said his bid applied in the case of the CIA officers and a number of former
officers of the Ministry of State security in the former East Germany - the
``Stazi''.<
``They are in a different position,'' said Mr Boyd.<
``Were their true identities, physical expressions and voices to be revealed,
the Crown understands they and their families would be ostracised and those in
employment would run the very real risk of losing their employment,'' he said.<
He then went on to refer to a witness said to fall within the terms of the US
Federal Witness Protection Programme, whose safety and that of his family would
also be put at risk.<
``There are very real concerns about the safety of this witness'', said Mr
Boyd.<
Mr Boyd referred to Libya TV coverage in Tripoli in 1993 of a rally where
Libyan leader Col Gadaffi was present.<
At that rally, individuals who claim to be members of the witness's family
``denounced this particular individual'' and regarded his ``physical
liquidation'' as legitimate, said Mr Boyd.<
``That was broadcast in 1993 but the concern for his safety is still very real
and very present.''<
Mr Boyd made a similar bid on behalf of an officer of the Swedish Intelligence
Service saying that if his true identity, physical appearance and voice were to
be revealed, his personal safety and that of his family would be at risk.<
And he asked for a member of the British Security Services - ``Mr A'' - also
to give his evidence in a way enabling his true identity of features to be
concealed.<
