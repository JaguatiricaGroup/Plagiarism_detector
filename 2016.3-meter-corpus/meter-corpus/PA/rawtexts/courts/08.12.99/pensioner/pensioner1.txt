By James Morrison, PA News<
Two men who murdered a frail pensioner by leaving her with a T-shirt tied
round her neck after ransacking her flat were today jailed for life.<
Patrick Rattigan, 22, and Terence Wyatt, 28, bound 88-year-old Hilda Tizard
with her own clothes and shoelaces before fleeing her sheltered home at Victoria
Drive, Bognor, West Sussex, with #33 of her pension, Lewes Crown Court heard.<
Rattigan, of Canada Grove, Bognor, and Wyatt, of South Terrace, Littlehampton,
both then studying health and fitness at Chichester College, denied murder.<
But within five hours of the end of a two-week trial, the jury found them
unanimously guilty.<
Sentencing the two to life imprisonment this afternoon, Mr Justice Potts said:
``You two men are being convicted on clear evidence of a callous and brutal
attack on a defenceless old woman.<
``It will be many years before you are released and you will never be released
while you remain a threat to the community.''<
