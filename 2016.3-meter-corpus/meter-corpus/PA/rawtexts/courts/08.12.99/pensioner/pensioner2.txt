The court heard how, sometime after 11.30pm on December 16 last year, the pair
entered Mrs Tizard's home through an open window.<
Timothy Langdale QC, prosecuting, told the jury said there was no dispute that
the two had burgled the flat together, but each was blaming the other for the
victim's death.<
The jury was told how, on the following day, Mrs Tizard's body was found.<
Mr Langdale said a T-shirt or vest-type garment had been tied around her neck,
and her wrists and ankles had been bound with brown laces taken from shoes found
in the flat.<
A post mortem examination found the cause of death was asphyxia and Mrs Tizard
had bruises and abrasions on her arms and legs, suggesting there had been a
struggle.<
He said she may also have been smothered by cushions placed over her body.<
Mrs Tizard's killers escaped with #33 in cash and a few other items, some of
which were later found discarded in nearby gardens.<
Mr Langdale added that, in the early hours of the morning following the
attack, Rattigan was spotted by video cameras making a call from a telephone box
to report seeing two men running away from Mrs Tizard's flat.<
The jury delivered its verdict on Wyatt after four hours of deliberation,
before taking a further half an hour to find Rattigan guilty.<
The judge concluded the case by thanking the police for their prompt response
to the discovery of Mrs Tizard's body.<
Turning to the jury, he added: ``This has been a wearing and distressing case
for us all.<
``I know how it must affect you, because it affects anybody, even those who
have got experience of such matters, when listening to details such as we've
heard in the last couple of weeks or so.''<
