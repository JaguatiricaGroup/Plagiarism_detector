SCHOOLBOY WAS LURED INTO GAY'S SECRET WORLD<
By Brian Farmer and Paul Peachey, PA News<
Kevan Roberts inhabited a secret and sleazy world into which he drew schoolboy
Thomas Marshall _ before killing him because he feared he was about to be
unmasked.<
By day the 52-year-old homosexual bachelor presented a cheery
``do-anything-for-anybody'' image at his shop, Granville's Stores, on the Bush
estate in Eccles, on the north Norfolk coast.<
But at closing time, Roberts, who described himself as a ``reclusive loner'',
retreated into a sad and shabby world of pornography, seedy sexual liaisons and
child exploitation.<
Less than two years before Thomas was strangled, police learned that two
teenage boys had made obscene videos of themselves in the same flat.<
Roberts had given the boys his video camera and let them videotape themselves
in his bathroom. He watched their films with them but then ``forgot'' to wipe
the tapes to erase the pictures.<
He had also let the youngsters sample some of his huge collection of
pornographic videos, which included titles such as Cadet Camp, Action Boys and
Teen Sex.<
In his defence, Roberts said he had only allowed the children to watch
heterosexual pornography.<
Police and Crown Prosecution Service lawyers decided to caution Roberts for
possessing an indecent photograph. He was never taken to court, so the offence
was not reported in local newspapers.<
Detective Chief Inspector Bill Goreham, who led the murder investigation,
said: ``It was felt in the light of all the evidence that a caution was the best
way to deal with the incident. Roberts had no previous convictions.''<
Many in Eccles were shocked when Roberts was charged with Thomas's murder, and
refused to believe that he could be guilty.<
Roy Scannell, who lived near Roberts's shop, and supplied him with cannabis in
the week Thomas died, said: ``I used to have a tab at the shop and just pay when
I could afford the things, and a lot of other people did as well. He'd do
anything for anybody. It was quite a shock.''<
Helen Howard, who has a caravan in the village, said: ``He was a very pleasant
person. We all knew he was gay but that didn't affect us in any way.<
``He was quite a small-built, slight, person and I wouldn't think he would
want to hurt anybody.''<
But some residents were suspicious.<
Graham Beecroft, 22, said: ``I thought it was him to start with. So did a lot
of other people because of the amount of time he used to spend with him
(Thomas).''<
He added: ``Thomas's bike was outside the shop nearly every time I went.''<
Unknown to the people of Eccles, Roberts had been living a sordid and
disturbing private life for many years.<
Roberts was born in Neasden, north west London, where he lived, on and off,
until the mid-1990s.<
He realised he was homosexual in his early teens, when he started to engage in
playground sex acts with his cousin Peter Roberts, now in his early 50s and a
dairy manager in Thetford, Norfolk.<
Kevan Roberts spent two years in Australia, living with one of his brothers.
Then, aged 24, he returned to England and joined the Royal Navy as a medical
assistant.<
He was discharged two years later, when his commanding officer learned that he
had gone through a homosexual ``marriage'' to a civilian man.<
Roberts moved back to his parents' home in Neasden, and spent nearly 20 years
working as a telephone engineer, later taking a job in a nearby Ikea furniture
store.<
Neighbours in Neasden remember him as a ``weird'' man with an unhealthy
interest in children and an appetite for pornographic videos.<
Unemployed Mark Lloyd said of Roberts: ``He was like a loner, a recluse. He
said he had lots of boyfriends in the street. He could be a bit strange
sometimes.''<
Another former neighbour in Neasden, who asked not to be named, said: ``I
think he was capable of killing.<
``About five years ago I saw him with a kitchen knife chase a man out of his
house. His face and knuckles were white as a sheet with rage. He'd lost it. He
was gone. He could kill.''<
After his parents died, Roberts moved to Eccles, buying Granville's Stores, so
he could be near his sister Natasha, who lived on the Bush Estate with her
husband Terry.<
He resumed his homosexual relationship with his cousin, Peter Roberts, who was
now married with grown-up children _ the two men met for occasional sexual
liaisons at the flat behind his shop in which Kevan Roberts lived.<
Before long, local youngsters were beating a path to Roberts's door _ and
being allowed into his living quarters.<
Roberts would give them soft drinks and cigarettes, and turn a blind eye when
they stole from the store.<
He would play games of hide and seek, and meet them after hours _ although,
apart from the videotaping incident, none complained of any sexual abuse.<
Roberts met Thomas Marshall in the summer of 1997.<
He later told police the youngster was cheeky, untrustworthy and a nuisance _
going out of his way to blacken the youngster's character.<
Yet Roberts had never barred Thomas from the shop, never complained to the
boy's parents, and kept giving him treats to encourage him to return.<
He also discussed his sexuality with the youngster and talked about
drug-taking.<
Roberts told the jury he did not think such conversations inappropriate with a
boy of Thomas's age.<
Detectives believe that Roberts was sexually abusing Thomas, then buying his
silence.<
Thomas was excited when he left home on the night he died. His parents, Carol
and John Marshall, could not work out why.<
Police fear that Roberts had invited Thomas to his home and that the confident
but naive youngster had no way of knowing what deep water he was getting into.<
Officers suspect that Thomas met his death when he threatened to expose the
shopkeeper.<
The youngster was strangled from behind _ possibly over Roberts's sink _ with
his shoelace necklace and black T-shirt.<
Bruising also indicated that he might have been sexually abused before he
died.<
