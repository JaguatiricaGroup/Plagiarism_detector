TINY BEAD LED TO KILLER'S DOWNFALL<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
Shopkeeper Kevan Roberts believed for more than a year that he had got away
with murdering 12-year-old Thomas Marshall.<
Detectives questioned him soon after the killing, but did not charge him.<
Police, who spent about #2 million on Norfolk's most expensive murder
investigation, were initially stymied by a lack of solid forensic evidence.<
But cunning Roberts made three crucial errors.<
First, he thought that he could hide his link to Roudham Heath picnic area,
near Thetford, a known venue for homosexual men, where he had dumped Thomas's
body, simply by denying it.<
Second, he forgot to dispose of Thomas's black shoelace necklace _ and failed
to realise that the small but significant piece of evidence which was to convict
him was lodged in the muck of the trap in the waste pipe from his sink.<
Third, he never considered the lengths to which determined detectives would go
to uncover the truth about Thomas's murder.<
Police were trying to find someone with links to both the Happisburgh area and
Thetford.<
Roberts, who had run a general store in Eccles since the mid-1990s, denied
having a connection with Thetford.<
But detectives kept a close check on his movements and discovered that he was
in touch with someone in the Thetford area.<
Further inquiries led them to Roberts's cousin, Peter Roberts, the manager of
a Thetford dairy, in his early 50s, who is married with grown children - and it
emerged that the two men had been having a homosexual affair for five years.<
They then discovered that Peter Roberts had called Kevan Roberts at 7.59pm on
August 21, the evening Thomas vanished. It was the vital breakthrough.<
Peter Roberts told detectives he had phoned Kevan Roberts on August 20, 1997,
to arrange a liaison for the following evening, but that his cousin had said he
was going out _ the first time he had refused a meeting.<
Peter, angry at the rejection, called Kevan Roberts's number the following
night _ August 21, the day Thomas Marshall was murdered _ to check his story,
and hung up without speaking when his cousin answered the phone.<
Detectives already knew that Kevan Roberts had bought cannabis from a
neighbour, saying he was expecting a visitor on the evening of August 21. They
also knew that Thomas Marshall had been excited and in a hurry to go somewhere
on the night he vanished.<
At this point detectives focused their interest on Thomas's necklace. Forensic
experts had found no evidence on Thomas's body, or in Kevan Roberts's Volvo car
or his Rascal van.<
The broken black necklace had been caught up in the collar of Thomas's black
T-shirt, which told police that Thomas was strangled from behind with a
combination of the two. But two tiny silver-coloured beads were missing from the
front of the necklace.<
Detective Chief Inspector Bill Goreham, who led the investigation, said: ``It
was apparent to us when he was found at Roudham Heath that Thomas had been
strangled. It was apparent that this was ligature strangulation, and that the
ligature was his own necklace.<
``Thomas died because his own necklace was pulled tight around his neck. The
necklace snapped and two beads were missing. It was our belief that those beads
were out there somewhere.<
``The search for those two beads became a major line of inquiry and we looked
for them anywhere we thought might be suspicious.<
``I was asking the search teams to look for them a year after we had first
searched Roberts' vehicles _ and I was beginning to think `Am I asking too much
of them?'<
``During all our searches of Roudham Heath, verges, the undergrowth where the
bike was found and various other premises we didn't find anything close to a
bead.''<
Kevan Roberts's flat was searched on the day he was arrested. The vital bead
was found after officers had been working for about seven hours.<
Mr Goreham said: ``We didn't know what we would find.<
``The search officer was working in the sink trap. There was all sorts of hair
and fat and grease and general muck and whatever in the sink trap.<
``He took a substance out. He was feeling around in the stuff when he felt
there was something hard in the middle, which he could not make out.<
``He had found what appeared to be a small metal bead.''<
Mr Goreham went on: ``We traced the manufacturers of the necklace that Thomas
was wearing. These particular beads were made in Hong Kong.<
``It was a matter of finding out how unique these beads were. We sent officers
to Hong Kong and tried to find out everything we could about Thomas's necklace.<
``It was a very unusual inquiry. I have certainly never been involved in
anything like it before. It was amazing how many inquiries could spring from
something as simple as a bead.<
``I was personally surprised at how something that cost perhaps #1.99 or #2
could have had so much effort put into making it. There were thousands and
thousands of these necklaces and so many different types, with slight
differences here and parts that were unique to this manufacturer or that.<
``And it was a big task trying to identify this one. It was actually made of
brass covered in a nickel-type substance.<
``What we can say now with certainty is that the bead is from the same batch
as the necklace Thomas was wearing. There would be several thousand in that
batch.''<
Police could find no-one who had access to Kevan Roberts's property who could
account for the bead, Mr Goreham said.<
Although the shopkeeper was charged with murder in December 1999, his lawyers
still felt there were enough weaknesses in the police case to win an acquittal.<
No-one saw Thomas or his bicycle in Eccles on the evening of August 21, no one
saw Kevan Roberts leave his home or saw him with the youngster, and there was no
forensic evidence.<
Then, a week into the trial _ and more than two years after the murder _ a new
witness came forward.<
Nineteen-year-old Emma Coleman, who was Kevan Roberts's neighbour at the time
of Thomas's murder, read a newspaper report of the trial which told how Thomas's
reddish-pink mountain bike had been dismantled before being dumped at Brumstead
Common, about three miles from Happisburgh.<
She suddenly remembered having once looked through a hole in Kevan Roberts's
fence to see him standing in front of an upturned reddish-pink mountain bike
with something in his hand.<
She said ``Hello'', and a few seconds later Roberts's phone rang and he
disappeared indoors.<
Miss Coleman, who now lives in Norwich, could not remember the date _ although
she knew it was around the time that Thomas Marshall vanished. But she thought
the time was about 8pm, as she remembered hearing the theme tune to the BBC1
soap series EastEnders playing from the television in her house.<
She told the jury: ``When I read about the bike being dismantled I thought `Oh
God'.<
``I felt sick. The significance of it never occurred to me before.''<
Mr Goreham said: ``That came out of the blue and it was clearly a key piece of
evidence. Here we had someone who remembered seeing Roberts with a bike at about
the time Thomas went missing and had no idea about this until she contacted us
during the trial after reading a newspaper.''<
