SHOPKEEPER BEGINS LIFE SENTENCE FOR BOY'S MURDER<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
Village shopkeeper Kevin Roberts was tonight beginning a life sentence after
being convicted of murdering 12-year-old Thomas Marshall.<
Roberts, 52, of Eccles, Norfolk, was described by a senior detective as a
``cold and calculating'' paedophile who had abused Thomas then strangled the
youngster because he feared that his crimes were about to be exposed.<
Thomas's parents, John and Carol Marshall, of Happisburgh, Norfolk, said they
were relieved that Roberts, who was alleged to have called the youngster a
``rent boy'', would no longer be free to prey on other children.<
Homosexual Roberts, who denied murder during a three-week trial at Norwich
Crown Court, was found guilty by the jury of eight men and four women who had
deliberated for nearly 10 hours.<
Mr Justice Smedley, passing sentence, told Roberts: ``You have been found
guilty of murdering a young 12-year-old boy who you described to a witness as
`no angel'. I have no doubt he wasn't, very few 12-year-old boys are, but he
didn't deserve to die in the appalling way you treated him.''<
The judge said he would recommended that Roberts' stay in prison would be
``well into double figures'' before parole could be considered.<
The jury heard that two years before Thomas died, Roberts had been cautioned
by police for allowing two teenage boys to make indecent videos of themselves in
his flat. Police also seized a large collection of pornographic videos from the
home at the back of Roberts' general store.<
