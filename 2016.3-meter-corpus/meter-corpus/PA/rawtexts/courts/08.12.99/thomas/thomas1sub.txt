LIFE FOR SHOPKEEPER WHO KILLED THOMAS, 12<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
A village shopkeeper was today jailed for life for the murder of 12-year-old
Thomas Marshall.<
Kevan Roberts, 52, of Eccles, Norfolk, was convicted by a unanimous verdict
following a two-week trial at Norwich Crown Court.<
Judge Mr Justice Smedley said any recommendation he made for a minimum jail
term would be in double figures.<
``There is only one sentence I can pass,'' the judge told Roberts. ``You have
been found guilty by the jury of strangling to death a young boy of 12.<
``You described him to a witness as 'not an angel'.<
``I have no doubt he was not - very few 12-year-olds are - but he didn't
deserve to die in the appalling way you treated him.''<
Roberts showed little emotion as he was led out of the dock, but there were
gasps from members of Thomas's family.<
