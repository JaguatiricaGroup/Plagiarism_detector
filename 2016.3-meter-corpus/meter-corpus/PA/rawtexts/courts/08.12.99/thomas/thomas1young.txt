PARENTS' TORMENT AS EVIDENCE TARNISHED SON<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
Carol and John Marshall today rejected the claims of shopkeeper Kevan Roberts
that their 12-year-old son Thomas was a ``thief'' or a ``rent boy''.<
John Marshall, who is in his early 50s and works in a county record office in
Norwich, and his wife, a part-time library assistant, who is in her 40s, said
the portrait of Thomas _ who would have been 15 on Tuesday _ which was given in
court was ``biased''.<
The couple said: ``No-one who knew him would recognise the boy described as
our Thomas.<
``He had a stable and loving family. We did not permit him to smoke, and do
not believe his references to drugs were any more than adolescent bravado.<
``Affectionate and loving at home, he was generally considerate and polite,
although at times cheeky, like any 12-year-old boy.<
``Thomas was intelligent and strong-willed and very anxious to appear grown
up. Inquisitive by nature, he lacked the experience to deal with a situation
into which his curiosity had led him.<
``Many children find themselves in such a position, most are fortunate to meet
people who guide them safely beyond this stage.''<
Thomas's memory would be honoured with the building of a memorial staircase
which would give people access to the top of St Mary's Church, Happisburgh,
where his funeral service was held, the couple said.<
Mr and Mrs Marshall, who have no other children, added: ``We feel this will be
a lasting tribute to Thomas that will bring pleasure to others.''<
Thomas's reputation was repeatedly blackened during shopkeeper Kevan Roberts's
two-week trial.<
Mr Charles Wide QC, prosecuting, opened the Crown's case at Norwich Crown
Court by telling the jury that Thomas had been ``sexually involved'' with
Roberts.<
Thomas's friends told how the youngster stole cigarettes from Roberts's shop,
talked about drugs, and laughed at the homosexual shopkeeper, calling him names
such as ``queer''.<
Roberts, in the words of Mr Wide, ``systematically denigrated'' Thomas's
memory, saying the youngster was rude, untrustworthy and a nuisance.<
Convicted prisoners told the jury that while on remand in jail Roberts had
referred to Thomas as a ``rent boy'' who wanted his ``money and his pleasure''.<
But friends of the Marshalls also spoke up for Thomas, saying the picture the
jury was given was not one they recognised.<
Jo Nash, who is in her 70s, and knew Thomas all his short life, said: ``He was
a nice little boy. He was a boy, yes. But in all my dealings with him he has
always been polite and a nice child.<
``He used to tease me and my husband a bit. But he was always a nice little
lad. I just cannot believe some of the things I have been reading _ that's not
the Thomas I know.''<
Mrs Nash and her husband George, of Bacton, Norfolk, spent many years in
Happisburgh and were close friends of the Marshalls.<
``We were with him the day before he died,'' Mrs Nash said. ``We went shopping
with his mother and she asked us to stop for lunch. We ate in the garden. He was
his normal self. His mother could not fill him up.''<
She added: ``My memories of him are all nice ones. I don't want people to be
left with this image of him that's come out in court. His parents can be proud
of him.''<
Detective Chief Inspector Bill Goreham, who led the murder investigation,
pointed out that much of what was said in court about Thomas came from Roberts.<
Police say it is common for paedophiles to try to blame their victims in an
attempt to excuse their own crimes.<
``Throughout the trial I think a picture was given of Thomas which is
unfair,'' Mr Goreham said.<
``Thomas was a very bright, mature 12-year-old who was mischievous to a
certain extent. But it is not unusual for boys of that age to push things as far
as they can, given the chance.''<
Jim Scott, head of Stalham Middle School, where Thomas was a pupil, said: ``He
was a bright lad who seemed to have a bright future. He was about to transfer to
the upper school.<
``He was in our top maths group and I'm sure he could have gone on to
university. Certainly we never had a problem with him in school.''<
