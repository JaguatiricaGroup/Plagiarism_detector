            17:17 08/12/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Thomas Nightlead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roberts had, in the words of prosecutor Charles Wide, QC, ``systematically
denigrated'' Thomas's character in an attempt to escape conviction.<
The shopkeeper told the court that Thomas, who would have been 15 on Tuesday,
was a ``rude'', ``untrustworthy'' ``nuisance'' who wanted to talk about sex and
drugs.<
He was said to have discussed intimate sexual details about the boy with
fellow paedophiles while on remand in prison awaiting trial.<
But Det Chief Insp Bill Goreham, who led the investigation, condemned Roberts,
who was said to have been involved in a ``sexual relationship'' with Thomas, for
trying to taint the dead youngster's name.<
``Let's make no bones about it. It was not a relationship. It was abuse by
Roberts of Thomas,'' said Mr Goreham.<
``Kevan Roberts was a very, very intelligent man. He is very cold, very
calculating, very clever. He obviously thought about what he had done and to a
large extent covered his tracks.''<
He added: ``Kevan Roberts, like so many people like him, lived a lie, covering
his tracks. People don't always realise who they have living on their
doorsteps.''<
Thomas's parents, John, in his early 50s, who works in a county record office
in Norwich, and Carol, in her 40s, a part-time library assistant, defended their
son's reputation.<
The couple, who were in court to hear most of the evidence but stayed away for
the verdict, said the view portrayed of Thomas in court was ``biased''.<
``No-one who knew him would recognise the boy described as our Thomas,'' said
Mr and Mrs Marshall.<
``He had a stable and loving family. We did not permit him to smoke and do not
believe his references to drugs were any more than adolescent bravado.<
``Affectionate and loving at home, he was generally considerate and polite,
although at times cheeky, like any 12-year-old boy.<
``Thomas was intelligent and strong willed and very anxious to appear grown
up.<
``Inquisitive by nature, he lacked the experience to deal with a situation
into which his curiosity had led him.<
``Although nothing can bring (Thomas) back the jailing of Roberts will ensure
that he is not able to prey on other children.''<
