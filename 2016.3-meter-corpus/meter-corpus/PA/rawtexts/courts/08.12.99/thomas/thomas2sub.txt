            14:32 08/12/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Thomas Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas vanished after cycling from his home in Happisburgh, Norfolk, on the
evening of August 21, 1997.<
He told his parents he was going to see a teenaged friend in neighbouring
Eccles. But the friend knew nothing of the arrangement.<
Thomas's body was found next day, 50 miles away, near Thetford, in a picnic
area used as a meeting place by homosexual men.<
He had been strangled from behind by a combination of his black shoelace
necklace and black round-necked T-shirt. There were no marks on his body to
suggest he had had an opportunity to struggle.<
Police think that he was suddenly attacked in Roberts's flat _ possibly while
getting a drink of water from the kitchen sink.<
Marks around Thomas's groin indicated that he might have been sexually abused
shortly before his death.<
The youngster's reddish pink mountain bike was found dismantled in a remote
woodland common three miles from Happisburgh.<
Two years before Thomas Marshall's death, police had cautioned Roberts, an
unmarried homosexual who ran a general store in Eccles, over an indecent video
which he had helped two young teenagers make in the bathroom of his home.<
The boys, who watched the videos with Roberts, who kept the tapes, had also
sampled some of Roberts large collection of pornographic videos.<
Police seized more than 20 videos from Roberts's bungalow. The collection
included titles such as Teen Sex, Cadet Camp and Action Boys.<
The prosecution had alleged that Roberts was sexually involved with Thomas and
murdered the youngster because he feared that his behaviour was about to be
exposed.<
The jury heard that Thomas had met Roberts earlier in the summer of 1997, when
he was taken to the shop by an older friend.<
Thomas had become a regular visitor to the shop and, along with other local
youngsters, was allowed into the flat-cum-bungalow behind the shop, where
Roberts lived.<
Mr Charles Wide, QC, prosecuting, told the jury of eight men and four women
that Thomas's broken shoelace necklace was found lying on his shoulder.<
Two tiny beads _ each about half the size of a pea _ from the necklace were
missing when police found the youngster's body.<
A bead matching one of those on the necklace was found stuck in the U-bend
under a sink in the flat at the back of Roberts's shop, when the shopkeeper was
arrested 13 months after Thomas's death.<
Roberts admitted to police that he found adolescent boys attractive but said
he had never had a sexual relationship with such a boy.<
But the jury heard that he had discussed his relationship with Thomas with two
prisoners while being held in custody awaiting trial.<
Roy Reynolds, a convicted paedophile serving a life sentence, said Roberts had
told him intimate sexual details about Thomas, saying he ``hated'' the youngster
because he was ``taking over his life'' and having it ``both ways''.<
Another prisoner said Roberts had referred to Thomas as a ``rent boy''.<
Roberts had denied having made the comments.<
A former neighbour of Roberts came forward during the trial to tell the jury
she remembered seeing the shopkeeper in his garden standing over an upturned
pinkish red mountain bike on a night around the time Thomas vanished.<
Emma Coleman, 19, said she had not realised the significance of what she had
seen when police questioned her shortly after Thomas's death.<
She said reading a report of the trial had triggered the memory and made her
``feel sick''.<
