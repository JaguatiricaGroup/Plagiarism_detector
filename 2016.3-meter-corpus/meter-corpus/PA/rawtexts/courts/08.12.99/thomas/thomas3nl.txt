  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas, who would have been 15 yesterday, vanished after cycling away from his
home early in the evening of August 21 1997.<
He told his parents that he was going to see a teenage friend in neighbouring
Eccles. But the friend knew nothing of the arrangement.<
His body was found 50 miles away near Thetford, in a picnic area used as a
meeting place by homosexual men, the following day.<
The youngster's reddish pink mountain bike was found dismantled in a remote
woodland common three miles from Happisburgh. He had been strangled from behind
by a combination of his black shoelace necklace and black round-necked T-shirt.<
There were no marks on his body to suggest that he had an opportunity to
struggle.<
Police think that he was suddenly attacked in Roberts' flat - possibly while
getting a drink of water from the kitchen sink.<
Mr Wide told the court that Thomas's broken shoelace necklace was found lying
on his shoulder.<
Two tiny beads - each about half the size of a pea - from the necklace were
missing when police found the youngster's body.<
A bead matching one of those on the necklace was found stuck in the U-bend
under a sink in the flat at the back of Roberts' shop, when the shopkeeper was
arrested 13 months after Thomas's death.<
Marks around Thomas's groin indicated that he might have been sexually
interfered with shortly before his death.<
Roberts admitted to police that he found adolescent boys attractive but said
he had never had a sexual relationship with such a boy.<
The jury heard that Thomas had met Roberts earlier in the summer of 1997 when
he was taken to the shop by an older friend.<
A former neighbour of Roberts came forward during the trial to tell the jury
how see remembered seeing the shopkeeper in his garden standing over an upturned
pinkish red mountain bike on a night around the time Thomas vanished.<
Roberts, who was  having a homosexual relationship with his cousin Peter
Roberts, a married father, from Thetford, had also lied about going out.<
He had told Peter Roberts not to visit him on the evening of Thomas's
disappearance because he would not be in. But he had answered the phone at 1959
on August 21 when Peter called.<
Roberts had tried to hide his affair with his cousin from police because he
knew that it would link him to Thetford and the spot where Thomas's body was
found.<
The jury heard that in the early 1970s Roberts had been a medical assistant in
the Royal Navy. One of his jobs was to assist at post-mortem examinations and he
was therefore familiar with handling bodies.<
Roberts was discharged after two years when his commanding officer learned
that he had undergone a homosexual ``marriage'' to a civilian man and changed
his name by deed poll.<
The relationship came to light when officers were sent ``compromising''
pictures of Roberts. Roberts, who was based at Plymouth, Devon, during his
service, changed his name back when the relationship ended.<
His former partner said he did not wish to discuss his involvement with
Roberts, saying: ``It was all such a very long time ago. I have nothing to say
about it.''<
