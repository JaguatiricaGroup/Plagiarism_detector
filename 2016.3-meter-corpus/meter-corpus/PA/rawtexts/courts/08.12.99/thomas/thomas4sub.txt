The Marshall family later released a statement expressing relief ``that justice
has been done''.<
The family said: ``Yesterday would have been Thomas' 15th birthday, a birthday
he didn't live to celebrate. Although nothing can bring him back, the jailing of
Roberts will ensure that he is not able to prey on other children.<
``Having sat through the trial, we are convinced that Roberts murdered
Thomas.''<
The Marshalls expressed their thanks to the police who helped them through the
ordeal, saying: ``We have 100% support from them. We would like to thank the
prosecuting counsel and his staff, witness support, friends and strangers for
all their support.''<
The family added: ``Some people have questioned the cost of the inquiry. No
cost should be placed on human life. It was right that no effort was spared and
no stone left unturned in bringing Thomas's killer to justice.''<
