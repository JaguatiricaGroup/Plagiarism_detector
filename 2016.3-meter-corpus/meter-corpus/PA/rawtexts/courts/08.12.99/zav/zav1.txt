INQUEST RESUMES INTO DEATH OF FORMER CHILD STAR<
By Brendan Berry, PA News<
An inquest was today being held into the death of former child star Lena
Zavaroni.<
Miss Zavaroni, 35, died in Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales in October,
nearly a month after undergoing brain surgery aimed at beating her anorexia.<
As a 10-year-old she shot to fame in the 70s' TV talent show Opportunity
Knocks but developed the eating disorder by the time she was 13.<
There were no obvious indications that the surgery was directly responsible
for her death _ but the results of further tests are expected to be given in
Cardiff today by medical witnesses.<
At an earlier hearing, South Glamorgan coroner Dr Lawrence Addicott gave the
preliminary cause of death as bronchial pneumonia.<
Scottish-born Miss Zavaroni was divorced and at the time of her death was on
state benefits and renting a small council flat at Hoddesdon, Herts.<
