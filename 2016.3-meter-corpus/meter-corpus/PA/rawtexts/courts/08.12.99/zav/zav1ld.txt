NATURAL CAUSES VERDICT AT ZAVARONI INQUEST<
By Brendan Berry and Sarah Westcott, PA News<
Former child star Lena Zavaroni had threatened to kill herself unless she had
a brain operation to treat her depression, an inquest heard today.<
Miss Zavaroni, 35, who shot to fame in the 1970s TV talent show Opportunity
Knocks had neurosurgery in Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales but died
nearly four weeks later after developing a chest infection.<
The tragic Scottish-born singer weighed just 24kg (less than 4 stones) when
she died, the Cardiff inquest was told.<
Miss Zavaroni suffered from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa for more than
20 years and also from a depressive illness.<
Giving evidence consultant neurosurgeon Dr Brian Simpson said Miss Zavaroni
was ``very very keen indeed to have this operation performed.<
``She had taken an overdose of drugs shortly before then and expressed the
view that if she couldn't have the operation, or if it wasn't successful, then
she would kill herself.''<
But the specialist insisted that all the correct procedures had been followed,
with a full medical assessment and lengthy discussions with the former star
about the operation and its possible effects.<
Mr Simpson said the surgery itself had been successful and the medical team
were surprised when Miss Zavaroni developed the chest infection some weeks
later.<
''The development of the chest infection surprised everyone because at that
stage she was getting better and she was about to be transferred to Whitchurch
Hospital in Cardiff for rehabilitation. It came out of the blue.''<
Pathologist Dr James Neill gave her cause of death as bronchial pneumonia. He
said there was no evidence of infection or abrasion on her brain.<
Dr Neill said her emaciated condition and her weight of 24kg at the time of
death would have made it more difficult for her immune system to fight off
infection.<
Miss Zavaroni's father, Victor, was among relatives attending the hearing. He
questioned why neurosurgeons had not waited to operate until his daughter had
put on more weight.<
But Mr Simpson said he did not believe Miss Zavaroni's weight had been a
crucial factor in her contracting pneumonia.<
The former star had pleaded to have the operation but the surgery had been
thoroughly discussed and considered over a period of many months, he added.<
Recording a verdict of death by ``natural causes'', South Glamorgan coroner Dr
Lawrence Addicott added: ``On the evidence we have heard, it does not link the
operation with bronchial pneumonia which was the cause of death.''<
Later a statement issued by the University Hospital of Wales said: ``Everybody
who was involved in looking after Miss Zavaroni was deeply saddened by her
tragic and unexpected death and our thoughts are with her family and friends.<
``The inquest has provided an opportunity to clarify certain important
points.<
``The operation was not for anorexia. There is no operation for anorexia. It
was performed to try to relieve the considerable suffering caused by her severe
depressive illness which had not responded to any other treatment.<
``The operation was not a lobotomy, neither was it experimental. Physically,
it was a relatively minor procedure and Miss Zavaroni came through it without
difficulty.<
``There were already signs that it may have been successful when, more than
three weeks later, she developed a chest infection which tragically overwhelmed
her despite intensive treatment.''<
