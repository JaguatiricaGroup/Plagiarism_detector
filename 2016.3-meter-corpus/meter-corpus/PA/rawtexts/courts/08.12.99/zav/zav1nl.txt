TRAGIC LENA SPOKE OF STAGE COMEBACK, INQUEST TOLD<
By Sarah Westcott and Brendan Berry, PA News<
Just days before her tragic death, former child star Lena Zavaroni was talking
about a return to the stage, an inquest heard today.<
But after brain surgery to treat years of debilitating depression, the
35-year-old singer developed a chest infection which killed her.<
Scottish-born Miss Zavaroni had taken a drugs overdose and threatened to kill
herself unless surgeons agreed to an operation to correct part of her brain.<
The frail and emaciated singer who had battled with the anorexia nervosa
eating disorder for more than 20 years, underwent the `` relatively minor''
operation at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales on September 7 this year.<
Consultant neurosurgeon Brian Simpson told the Cardiff inquest that after the
90-minute operation Miss Zavaroni, weighing three-and-a-half-stone, was ``very
well''.<
``She asked me if I thought there was any chance she would get back on the
stage. She was talking about her family and about her future,'' he added.<
But after three weeks, the singer's condition deteriorated ``rapidly and
profoundly'' and despite antibiotics treatment in intensive care she died on
October 1 with her family at her bedside.<
Miss Zavaroni, who shot to fame in the 1970s TV talent show Opportunity
Knocks, died from bronchial pneumonia, the inquest heard.<
``It did not appear to be related directly to the operation,'' said Mr
Simpson. But he did acknowledge that her chronic malnourished state made it more
difficult for her body to fight infection.<
Miss Zavaroni's father Victor, sister Carla, 37, and stepmother Christine sat
in the front of the court to attend the hearing.<
Questioning whether his daughter was strong enough to undergo surgery, Mr
Zavaroni asked: ``Why didn't they wait? I am sure that if Lena so desperately
wanted the operation she would have agreed to put on half a stone''.<
But Mr Simpson said the surgery had ``passed off uneventfully'' and that a
brain scan had confirmed that the procedure had been successful.<
He insisted that the operation had been for her depression and not anorexia.<
``Her response was that she had learned to live with her anorexia and felt she
was in a kind of equilibrium with it.  But she said she could not live with the
increasing torment and suffering from the depressive illness.<
``She felt de-personalised. She felt she had no feelings or future. She
described this as torment.''<
Mr Simpson said Miss Zavaroni had been ``very, very keen indeed to have the
operation performed.''<
``She had taken a drugs overdose shortly before then and expressed the view
that if she couldn't have the operation, or if it was not successful, then she
would kill herself.''<
Mr Simpson insisted that stringent regulations covering operations under the
Mental Health Act had been followed and that Miss Zavaroni had been fully
consulted at every stage.<
The procedure uses keyhole surgery on the brain to partly interrupt the nerve
pathways that control emotions.<
A fine electrode is passed into the nerve fibre pathways to an accuracy of one
millimetre.<
Mr Simpson said he had carried out 36 similar operations and was surprised at
the development of a chest infection afterwards.  ``It surprised everybody
because at that stage she was getting better. This came out of the blue.''<
Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, South Glamorgan coroner Dr
Lawrence Addicott said: ``On the evidence we have heard, there is no distinct
and definite connection with the operation. She died of bronchial pneumonia.''<
As her family left without commenting, 20 protesters carrying placards
demonstrated against the use of pyschosurgery.<
Margaret McNair, director of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, part of
the Church of Scientology movement, said: ``Nobody can endure this kind of
treatment when they weigh three-and-a-half stone. Pyschosurgery by any name is
medieval, barbaric and inhumane.''<
Later a University of Wales Hospital spokesman said: ``Everybody who was
involved in looking after Miss Zavaroni was deeply saddened by her tragic and
unexpected death and our thoughts are with her family and friends.''<
A hospital statement said: ``The operation was not a lobotomy, neither was it
experimental. Physically, it was a relatively minor procedure and Miss Zavaroni
came through it without difficulty.<
``There were already signs that it may have been successful when, more than
three weeks later, she developed a chest infection which tragically overwhelmed
her despite intense treatment.''<
