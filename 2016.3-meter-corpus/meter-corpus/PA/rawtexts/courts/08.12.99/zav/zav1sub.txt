SINGER ZAVARONI `MADE OVERDOSE THREAT'<
By Brendan Berry, PA News<
Former child star Lena Zavaroni told doctors she would kill herself unless she
underwent brain surgery to treat her depressive illness, an inquest heard
today.<
The tragic singer took a drugs overdose last year while doctors were assessing
whether she could have the neuro-surgery, it was revealed.<
Miss Zavaroni, 35, died in Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales on October 1
after developing a chest infection following neuro-surgery in September.<
Giving evidence at a resumed hearing in Cardiff, consultant neuro-surgeon
Brian Simpson said: ``Miss Zavaroni was very, very keen indeed to have this
operation performed.<
``Miss Zavaroni had taken an overdose of drugs shortly before that and
expressed the view that if she couldn't have the operation, or if it wasn't
successful, then she would kill herself.''<
Mr Simpson described how the singer suffered from the eating disorder anorexia
nervosa for more than 20 years and depressive illness for almost the same length
of time.<
Mr Simpson told South Glamorgan Coroner Dr Lawrence Addicott that the former
star had previously undergone a number of drug treatments and also ECT (Electro
Convulsive Therapy).<
``None of these treatments had been effective - at least not in the long
term,'' he said.<
Miss Zavaroni had been referred to the University Hospital of Wales in the
summer of 1998 by a consultant psychiatrist and was first seen at the hospital
in November of that year. <
Mr Simpson explained that he and colleagues had thoroughly discussed all the
implications of an operation including its risks, benefits, and various
likelihoods.<
Beforehand, Miss Zavaroni had attended Whitchurch Hospital in the city in
order to try drug therapy under maximum dosage.<
But Dr Brian Harris had studied the results and did not consider this
treatment had been successful.<
Under the regulations of the Mental Health Act, a representative panel of
experts had interviewed the medical team and also discussed the operation with
Miss Zavaroni herself. <
The inquest was told that after surgery Miss Zavaroni developed a chest
infection and died from bronchial pneumonia.<
He hearing continues.<
