          11:58 08/12/99: Page 2 (HHH) INQUEST Zavaroni Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The inquest heard Miss Zavaroni was admitted to hospital and underwent the
one-and-a-half hour operation on September 7.<
Mr Simpson, the consultant neurosurgeon who looked after Miss Zavaroni at the
University Hospital of Wales, told the hearing: ``It passed off uneventfully.''<
And although it ``is recognised that chronic malnutrition does lower
resistance to infection ... there was nothing that alarmed us or put us on
guard''.<
He told the coroner that Miss Zavaroni weighed 30kg (less than five stones)
and was seen to be in a satisfactory condition for the operation, after
undergoing a series of failed treatments including antidepressants and ECT.<
Mr Simpson stressed the operation was supposed to cure the depressive illness
she suffered and not the debilitating anorexia nervosa she had battled since the
age of 13.<
``Her response was that she had learned to live with her anorexia and felt she
was in a kind of equilibrium with it. She said she could not live with the
increasing torment and suffering from the depressive illness,'' he said.<
``She felt depersonalised, she felt she had no feelings or future. She
described this as torment.''<
Mr Simpson described the brain surgery, called a leucotomy, as a ``not a major
operation in physical terms''.<
He said the procedure, first carried out in 1952, involved passing a fine
electrode into the nerve fibre pathways of the brain with an accuracy of ``about
1mm''.<
He said: ``The principle is to partly interrupt the connection between the
parts of the brain that control emotional functions and the frontal lobes.''<
Mr Simpson said a brain scan on Miss Zavaroni confirmed her lesions from the
operation were in ``exactly the right place''.<
He said she went through some mild confusion, a little disorientation and a
period on incontinence which was ``usual'' and by the end of the first week she
was ``making telephone calls, cheerful and engaging in conversation.<
``She then became very withdrawn for several days and her incontinence
worsened,'' he said. But then became ``brighter and making eye contact with
people which she had not been doing.<
``The nurses were saying: 'She is asking about our family'. She was talking
about her family, about her future.<
``She asked me if I thought there was any chance she would get back on the
stage, she was very well.''<
But the inquest heard that on September 29, Miss Zavaroni developed a chest
infection and was treated ``extremely intensively'' with antibiotics.<
  Mr Simpson said her condition worsened ``very rapidly and profoundly'' on
September 30 and the advice of  the intensive care specialist was sought.<
But he said Miss Zavaroni ``did not respond and during October 1 her condition
remained extremely poor.<
``It was the consensus of everybody that everything was being done but sadly
she died that evening,'' he said.<
He said the chest infection ``did not appear to be related directly to the
operation.''<
But that Miss Zavaroni's bone marrow was ``sparse'' which could ``alter the
ability to deal with infection''.<
