ENGINEER CONVICTED OF TRAIN STATION SEX ATTACK<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
A railway engineer was convicted at the Old Bailey today of indecently
assaulting an office worker on a railway platform - after he was caught on
camera.<
The star witness in Paul Frew's trial was a CCTV video showing him attacking
his 24-year-old, recently married victim.<
The woman herself had no memory of the assault. She had been celebrating last
St. Patrick's Day with fellow workers.<
``I don't remember any of that night. I was shocked and became hysterical when
I saw the video. I don't remember any of it. That made it all the more
upsetting,'' she told the court in evidence.<
She was escorted to Harrow and Wealdstone station, Middlesex by a colleague -
also the worse for drink, the court heard.<
He left her on a platform bench. The last train had left two hours earlier.<
While he was away, Frew, on a break, walked up the tracks to the station and
climbed on to the platform, the court heard.<
He looked around before manoeuvring her like a rag doll so he could molest
her.<
``She was plainly insensible through drink. He regrettably took advantage of
her, knowing perfectly well she was in no state to consent,'' said Catherine
Popert, prosecuting.<
Frew, 35, from Milton Keynes, Bucks, was convicted of indecent assault and
remanded for pre-sentence reports. He had denied the charge. He was cleared of
attempted rape on order of the judge, which he also denied.<
The video in the platform camera was the main evidence against him.<
He had previously been convicted of stealing ladies underwear from a washing
line.<
