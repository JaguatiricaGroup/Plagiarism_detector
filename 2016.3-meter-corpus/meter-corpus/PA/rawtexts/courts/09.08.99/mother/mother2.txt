Buckle sobbed uncontrollably in the dock as Recorder Rhys Davies QC passed
sentence.<
He told Buckle this was one of the most unusual cases he had come across.<
The judge said that Buckle had not taken up the offer of help from social
services to look after his alcoholic mother and was guilty of gross neglect.<
Describing the level of neglect, he said: ``It was such that she was
extensively infested with maggots - a condition which the pathologist had never
seen in a living human being.''<
The judge told Buckle that he had taken into consideration his alcohol
addiction and that the neglect was not deliberate.<
