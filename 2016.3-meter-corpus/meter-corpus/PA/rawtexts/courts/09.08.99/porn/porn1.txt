By Vanessa Allen, PA News<
A man thought to have compiled one of the biggest collections of computer
child pornography in Britain has begun a two-and-a-half year jail sentence.<
Police who seized a computer belonging to Andrew Mein, 43, found about 240,000
obscene images stored in it, including more than 9,000 involving children.<
Officers believe the seizure to be one of the biggest in Britain. They also
seized a video showing him performing sex acts with a girl.<
Mein, of Havant, Hants, pleaded guilty to 10 specimen counts of making
indecent photographs of children in the last two years, a Crown Prosecution
Service spokeswoman said today.<
Portsmouth Crown Court heard on Friday that he had downloaded the pornographic
images of children onto his computer at home.<
Police raided the address on May 25 this year and seized the computer and
video.<
The former Navy communications engineer also admitted five charges of indecent
assault on a girl under the age of 16, which he videoed.<
He was sentenced to 12 months concurrently for each of the pornography charges
and 18 months concurrently for each of the indecent assaults. These are to be
served consecutively, making a total of two-and-a-half years.<
Mein was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register.<
