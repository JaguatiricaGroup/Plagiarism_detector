DRINK-DRIVER FLED AFTER COLLISION WITH ROYAL DAIMLER<
By John Sheehan, PA News<
A drink-driver who ran into the Queen Mother's official Daimler was fined #700
and banned from driving for two years today.<
Eamon Reidy, 32, was two-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit when he
rammed the royal car, magistrates in Woking, Surrey, were told.<
The 99-year-old Queen Mother was not in the vehicle when the accident happened
on July 4 in Bishopsgate, Egham, Surrey.<
Magistrates were told that Reidy sped off before abandoning his car, running
across fields and hiding in undergrowth until he was spotted by the police
helicopter.<
Prosecuting Robin Bowen said: ``At 8pm the defendant was driving towards
Englefield Green in a black Citroen BX and collided with a Daimler limousine, a
vehicle which was used on a daily basis by the Queen Mother. She was not in it
at the time. It was being driven by a chauffeur.<
``He then reversed before driving forward at high speed, turned immediately
right and collided with a wall and some bushes.''<
Mr Bowen said Reidy jumped out of his car and was chased for one-and-a-half
miles by 56-year-old John Horton who had witnessed the accident. <
Mr Bowen said: ``Mr Horton pursued him for one-and-a-half miles before
catching up with him and taking hold of his arm. Mr Reidy threatened him and
told him to leave him alone. He let him go and the defendant ran off.''<
The court was told that police later discovered Reidy lying in undergrowth.<
Defending Ms Lesley Barry said Reidy had drunk two glasses of champagne at his
parents wedding anniversary party at lunchtime before drinking three pints of
strong lager in The Sun pub in Egham.<
She said Reidy and his partner were looking to buy a house and that the stress
of viewing properties and trying to arrange a mortgage had got to him.<
She said: ``He is not a man who normally goes to the pub to drink on his own
but he felt he wanted a bit of space to himself to mull over the finances of
purchasing the house.''<
She said he decided to walk home afterwards but returned a few minutes later
to pick up his car. <
She described how the accident happened, saying: ``He was driving along Wick
Lane and suddenly he was aware that there was a big black saloon car virtually
stationary in the road. He does not know where it came from. He was too close to
be able to stop.''<
She said that Reidy has been ``shaken up enormously'' by the crash and that he
was in a state of shock and panic before fleeing. Ms Barry said that Reidy had
become scared by Mr Horton and that he had run away across the fields.<
Airport worker Reidy, of Langley, near Slough, Berks, was banned from driving
for two years, fined #700 and ordered to pay #50 costs.<
