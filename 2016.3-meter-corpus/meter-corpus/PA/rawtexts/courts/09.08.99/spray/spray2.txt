                  15:12 09/08/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Spray
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside the court Pc Bateson, who has been on light duties since the
investigation began, said: ``I would like to thank my colleagues and friends for
standing by me over the last nine months while the investigation has taken
place.<
``Most of all I would like to thank my wife and family for standing by me.<
``I want to get back to full service again as soon as possible.''<
The court had heard how the officer had been called to a disturbance outside
the Farnworth Veterans' Club in Bolton where a fight had broken out after a
surprise birthday party.<
Pc Bateson and his partner, Pc Melanie James, had arrived to find several
fights going on around them and called for back-up.<
The court heard that Pc Davidson then arrived and was in the middle of a crowd
of people, including Miss Bagguley, whose boyfriend had been arrested, and Mr
Walsh, when they were sprayed with the disabling gas.<
Prosecuting, Leslie Portnoy, alleged Pc Bateson had ``panicked and
over-reacted'' to the situation.<
Pc Davidson told the court she had successfully calmed the group down and
convinced them to go home when they were sprayed with gas. She said: ``I felt
some liquid on one side of my face. <
``I looked and saw Pc Bateson holding a gas canister.<
``It was obvious he was gassing me and the females in the group.''<
She insisted no warning had been given about the spray being used and said
there was no reason for it to be used.<
But Pc Bateson, serving officer at Bolton Central for five years, dismissed
her claims that the situation had calmed down as ``rubbish''.<
He told the courts he had been forced to act because Pc Davidson was not doing
her job properly and he said he had shouted ``spray'' out of courtesy to other
officers to warn them what was happening.<
Pc Bateson, who has a commendation for ``commitment, professionalism and
dedication to duty'' said: ``I was concerned for Pc Davidson's safety and my
own.<
``Youths were around her, there had already been a violent scuffle and she was
being pulled and pushed around.<
``There were lots of screaming, shouting and swearing going on.''<
Pc Bateson said: ``My concern was for my safety and hers, she wasn't trying to
force these people's hands off her, she wasn't backing off, she was doing
nothing at all.''<
He said that he had a prisoner in one hand and he had tried to pull Pc
Davidson away with his other hand on two occasions before resorting to using the
gas after he saw Joanne Bagguley lunge at his colleague as if to hit her.<
