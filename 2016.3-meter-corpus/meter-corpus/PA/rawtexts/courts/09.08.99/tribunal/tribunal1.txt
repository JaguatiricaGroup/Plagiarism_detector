CANCER VICTIM WINS LANDMARK PAYOUT<
By Melanie Harvey, PA News<
A cancer sufferer today won what his lawyers described as a landmark legal
test case for unfair dismissal from his ex-employers.<
Former offshore oil company manager Tom McLauchlan, 52, won #82,018 in total
as a result of the Scottish tribunal hearing.<
That sum includes the biggest ever award by a Scottish tribunal for disability
discrimination, #79,708, and #2,310 for unfair dismissal, said solicitor Claire
McManus.<
Mr McLauchlan was sacked in July 1998 after being told by Stolt Comex Seaway
Ltd that there was no longer a place for him in the company where he worked as a
loss prevention manager.<
Bosses at the Aberdeen based firm dismissed him for lack of performance during
the period between the diagnosis of throat cancer in May 1997, and the date he
left the firm the following year.<
In his view, his illness was never taken into account by his employers and he
took the company to tribunal for unfair dismissal and discrimination under the
Disability Discrimination Act.<
Mr McLauchlan estimated he took no more than a total of 40 days off because of
the treatment and often struggled to work despite having a tube in his throat.<
Early in the tribunal proceedings, the company conceded the unfair dismissal
but continued to defend the action on disability discrimination.<
Ms McManus, of Glasgow law firm Harper Macleod, said: ``Employers should take
note of the results of this case and understand the implications.<
``The judgment helps to define the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act
which covers a wide range of issues affecting both physical and mental health.<
``The key message highlighted by this case is that if there is a downturn in
the performance of an employee, then a responsible employer must consider every
possible reason which they are aware of.<
``Tom has been under tremendous strain and I am delighted that he has achieved
the result he was seeking.''<
