                14:38 09/08/99: Page 2 (HHH) TRIBUNAL Cancer
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr McLauchlan said he was devastated when he learned of his dismissal,
particularly as the managing director of the firm was a family friend.<
``It was delivered in such a cold way,'' he said.<
``I was called into the office and I knew from the tone of his voice that
something was wrong. On my way I saw a colleague and I said `This is probably
the last time you will see me'.<
``I was told there was nothing available for me any more. It was
incredible.''<
Mr McLauchlan, who earned #60,000 in his former post, said he was offered a
pay-off of around #14,000 but turned it down and decided to take the company to
a tribunal.<
Ms McManus said Stolt Comex Seaway Ltd had always been aware of her client's
condition but Mr McLauchlan had been upbeat about his condition.<
She added: ``His employers were trying to say he was running around saying he
was cured of cancer. Tom never said that but he was upbeat and positive.<
``They knew it was a life or death situation and how serious it was.''<
She said that was the reason the tribunal found disability discrimination in
the case.<
She added: ``The award for disability discrimination was the biggest in a
Scottish tribunal, although there has been one in England that was bigger.''<
The tribunal decided that Mr McLauchlan was unfairly dismissed by the
company.<
He said he had been delighted when he heard of the decision, not just for
himself but for others in the same position.<
Mr McLauchlan paid tribute to his legal team and his wife Kathy, 36, who gave
birth to a son, Adam, a month ago.<
``I thank God for my wife, she had kept me going,'' added Mr McLauchlan, whose
cancer is now in remission.<
``She was also very happy about the decision, not just because of the money -
justice has been done.<
``This is not only a personal battle for me and the people who have helped me,
but for others.''<
He said he was now looking towards the future, adding: ``I live for every
day.<
``Now I have Adam and I want to make sure I see his 21st birthday.''<
