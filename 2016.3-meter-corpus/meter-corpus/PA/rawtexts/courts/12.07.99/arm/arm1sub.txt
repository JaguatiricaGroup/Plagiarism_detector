WOOD FIRM FINED #30,000 OVER TEEN'S LOST ARM<
By James Morrison, PA News<
A family-run timber merchants was today fined #30,000 after admitting
liability for an accident in which a teenage worker lost his arm.<
Tom Harrocks, 17, had his left arm amputated after it became caught in the
screw mechanism of a wood waste extraction silo at the firm, Wenban-Smith, of
Newlands Road, Worthing, West Sussex.<
The firm pleaded ``Guilty'' last month to three health and safety breaches in
relation to the incident last December.<
In an earlier hearing before Worthing magistrates, company director Harry
Honsa (correct) admitted failure to prevent access to the screw mechanism;
failure to ensure adequate training for workers; and failure to fully assess the
risks.<
The magistrates committed the company to Chichester Crown Court for sentence
where Judge Anthony Thorpe today fined Wenban-Smith #10,000 on each of the three
counts, and ordered it to pay costs of #3,640.<
