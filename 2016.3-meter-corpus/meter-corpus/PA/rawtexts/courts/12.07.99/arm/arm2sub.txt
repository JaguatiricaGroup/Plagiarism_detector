  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Harrocks declined to comment on the judgement, but confirmed he would be
pursuing a case for compensation.<
At the earlier hearing, it was described how the accident happened while Mr
Harrocks, of Upton Gardens, Worthing, was helping a senior worker give a silo at
the firm's plant in Dominion Way its Christmas clean.<
John Joseph, prosecuting, said the pair had entered the silo, which filters
out chips of sawdust poured in from above, while it was still switched on.<
Mr Joseph said the more experienced worker had gone to fetch some oil but was
about half-way down the ladder at the side of the silo when he heard Mr
Harrocks' screams.<
``He received serious injuries, in particular one leading to the amputation of
his left arm above the elbow,'' Mr Joseph said.<
He said there had been no panic button or ``off'' switch within the chamber
where the machine was situated.<
The court heard how Mr Honsa, whose company had been based in Worthing for 120
years and now employed 133 staff, had a good health and safety record.<
Since the accident, Mr Harrocks had been told his job was still open to him
and guaranteed a minimum of two years' pay.<
