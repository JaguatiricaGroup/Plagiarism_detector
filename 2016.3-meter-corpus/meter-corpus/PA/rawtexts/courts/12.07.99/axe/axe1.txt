TRIPLE AXE KILLER JAILED FOR LIFE<
By John Sheehan, PA News<
A drifter who killed three friends in a savage axe attack was jailed for life
today.<
Alan Hobbs, 32, was high on drugs when he hacked Gillian Harvey, Peter Smith
and Ian Brown to death in a flat in Slough, Berks, last August.<
Reading Crown Court was told that the bodies of the three lay undiscovered in
the flat for a week.<
The court was told that Hobbs, who was high on amphetamines, had murdered Miss
Harvey, 30, after having sex with her.<
Over the next 24 hours he then killed Ian Brown, 36 and Peter Smith, 31 after
tying them together when they came separately to visit Miss Harvey. Hobbs was
friendly with all three victims.<
Prosecuting Adrian Redgrave QC said: ``It was over the weekend of August 28-29
that this accused murdered three friends. He did so over a period of about 24
hours, all in the same house in Slough in circumstances of almost unimaginable
savagery and callousness.<
``It was on the afternoon of August 28 that he called at the house in Slough
where Gillian Harvey lived. He had sex with her. He then killed her.<
``Later that afternoon when her boyfriend, Ian Brown, arrived the accused
attacked him. He did not kill him at that stage. He bound and gagged him and
kept him prisoner until the following day.''<
