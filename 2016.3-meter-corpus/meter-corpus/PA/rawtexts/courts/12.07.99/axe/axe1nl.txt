TRIPLE AXE KILLER JAILED FOR LIFE<
By John Sheehan, PA News<
A drifter who killed three friends in an ``apparently motiveless'' axe attack
was given three life sentences today.<
Alan Hobbs, 32, was high on drugs when he hacked to death Gillian Harvey,
Peter Smith and Ian Brown in a flat in Slough, Berkshire last August.<
The three bodies lay undiscovered for a week.<
Hobbs, who was high on amphetamines and drink, murdered Miss Harvey, 30, after
having sex with her.<
He then killed Ian Brown, 36, and Peter Smith, 31, after tying them together
when they came separately to visit Miss Harvey.<
After the murders he went to visit his sister in Basingstoke, Hampshire, but
was arrested days later. Detectives tracked him down after he used one of the
victim's cash cards to withdraw money.<
Hobbs admitted murdering the three, all of whom he knew, when he appeared at
Reading Crown Court today.<
Adrian Redgrave QC, prosecuting, said: ``It was over the weekend of August
28-29 that this accused murdered three friends. He did so over a period of about
24 hours, all in the same house in Slough in circumstances of almost
unimaginable savagery and callousness.<
``It was on the afternoon of August 28 that he called at the house in Slough
where Gillian Harvey lived. He had sex with her. He then killed her.<
``Later that afternoon, when her boyfriend Ian Brown arrived, the accused
attacked him. He did not kill him at that stage. He bound and gagged him and
kept him prisoner until the following day.<
``He slept in the house that night and next day when Peter Smith called at the
house the accused attacked him with an axe. He similarly bound and gagged him
and then decided that these two men should die.<
``It is inevitable that assuming, as appears to be the case, he killed the two
of them at the same time that whoever was second to be killed both saw and heard
the killing of the first because he had tied the two of them together on a
bed.''<
Mr Redgrave told the court that Miss Harvey and Mr Brown lived together in the
flat and that Peter Smith, a former boyfriend of Miss Harvey, was still friendly
with the pair.<
Police called at the flat on a routine inquiry after the trio were reported
missing.<
Mr Redgrave said: ``Having walked down an alleyway, they noticed a smell which
became stronger and stronger the nearer they got to the house.<
``Looking through a window they could see swarms of flies inside and a cat in
obvious distress. The house was in darkness. The smell was intense. They
searched by torchlight and saw two dead bodies partially covered by clothing.<
``The full horror of these crimes became apparent when in the passageway they
found the partly-clothed Gillian Harvey.''<
She had suffered stab wounds to her back, head, neck and face. Her skull was
fractured. Two bloodstained knives and a chisel were found in the kitchen.<
A heavily-bloodstained axe was found in the bedroom near the bodies of the two
men. They had been tied together at the neck and ankles. One of the bodies was
also tied to a bicycle in the bedroom.<
Mr Redgrave described how Hobbs left the flat with a Nintendo game, a watch
and Peter Smith's Abbey National cash card. He was eventually arrested on
September 12 after a huge police hunt.<
He told police that he had sex with Miss Harvey before an argument broke out
between them. He then hit her with a chisel.<
He described tying up Mr Brown before going to sleep on a sofa in the flat.
The next morning he made him a cup of tea.<
He said he had been planning to leave the flat that morning, but as he walked
out Peter Smith arrived. Hobbs struck him with the blunt end of the axe. He then
tied him on the bed to Mr Brown. Hobbs then murdered the two men.<
Richard Benson QC, defending, said Hobbs had always expressed remorse and
dismay about what happened on that day and that he had a long history of drug
and substance abuse from when he was 11-years-old.<
Sentencing Hobbs, who had refused to undergo psychiatric analysis, to three
terms of life imprisonment, Mr Justice Blofeld said he should serve at least 20
years in jail before being considered for parole.<
He added: ``I find these matters inexplicable. Inevitably your conduct was
extremely wicked and your behaviour extremely callous.''<
Mr Justice Blofeld added that Hobbs had appeared to show no remorse for the
``three apparently motiveless crimes''.<
Hobbs, wearing a yellow, red and blue ``Kickers'' sweatshirt and flanked in
the dock by three prison officers, showed no emotion as sentence was passed.<
