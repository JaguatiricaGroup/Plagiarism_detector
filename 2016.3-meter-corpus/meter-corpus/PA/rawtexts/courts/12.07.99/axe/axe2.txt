Mr Redgrave continued: ``He slept in the house that night and next day when
Peter Smith called at the house the accused attacked him with an axe. He
similarly bound and gagged him and then decided that these two men should die.<
``It is inevitable that assuming, as appears to be the case, he killed the two
of them at the same time that whoever was second to be killed both saw and heard
the killing of the first because he had tied the two of them together on a
bed.''<
Mr Redgrave told the court that Miss Harvey and Mr Brown lived together in the
flat and that Peter Smith, a former boyfriend of Miss Harvey, was still friendly
with the pair.<
He said that Hobbs had known Miss Harvey for some years and had met Mr Brown
and Mr Smith on several occasions.<
The murders eventually came to light after Miss Harvey's mother reported her
missing and Mr Smith was reported missing by his family.<
Police officers who called at the flat on what they expected to be a routine
inquiry were met with an horrific sight.<
Mr Redgrave said: ``Having walked down an alleyway they noticed a smell which
became stronger and stronger the nearer they got to the house.<
``Looking through a window they could see swarms of flies inside and a cat in
obvious distress.''<
The officers then contacted a senior policeman before breaking down the door
of the flat.<
