Mr Redgrave said: ``The house was in darkness. The smell was intense. They
searched by torchlight and saw two dead bodies partially covered by clothing.
The full horror of these crimes became apparent when in the passageway they
found the partly clothed Gillian Harvey.''<
Mr Redgrave said that Miss Harvey had been subjected to two repeated attacks
and that she had suffered stab wounds to her back, head, neck and face. Her
skull was fractured.<
The court heard that two bloodstained knives were found in the kitchen and
that an axe was found in the bedroom near the bodies of the two men.<
Mr Redgrave added: ``By the bed was an axe which was heavily bloodstained. The
bodies of the two men were tied at the neck and ankles as well as each of them
having been tied with a complex series of knots. One of the bodies was also tied
to a bicycle in the bedroom.<
``Both men died of severe head injuries. The principal weapon was an axe found
in the bedroom. This accused must have struck repeated blows to the heads of
both men with all his force.''<
Mr Redgrave described how Hobbs calmly left the flat with a Nintendo game, a
watch and Peter Smith's Abbey National cashcard. He went to see his sister in
Basingstoke and twice withdrew sums of #250 from a cashpoint at a nearby
supermarket.<
Hobbs was eventually arrested on September 12 after a massive police hunt.<
