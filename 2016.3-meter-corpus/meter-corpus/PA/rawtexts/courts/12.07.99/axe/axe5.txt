In interviews with police, Hobbs said that he had been coming down from the
effects of taking amphetamine when he killed the trio. He had also been drinking
heavily.<
He told officers that he had sex with Miss Harvey before an argument broke out
between them. He then hit her with a chisel.<
Hobbs said that when Brown came in he tied him up before going to sleep on a
sofa in the flat. The following morning he made him a cup of tea before tying
him back up again.<
Hobbs told detectives that he had been planning to leave the flat that morning
but as he walked out Peter Smith arrived. As Mr Smith began to realise what had
happened, Hobbs struck him with the blunt end of the axe. He then tied him on
the bed to Mr Brown. Hobbs then murdered the two men.<
Richard Benson QC, defending, said: ``Mr Hobbs has always expressed remorse
and dismay about what happened on that day.''<
He said Hobbs had a long history of drug and substance abuse going back to the
age of 11.<
Sentencing Hobbs, who had refused to undergo psychiatric analysis, to three
terms of life imprisonment, Mr Justice Blofeld said he should serve at least 20
years in jail before being considered for parole.<
Mr Justice Blofeld said: ``I find these matters inexplicable. Inevitably your
conduct was extremely wicked and your behaviour extremely callous.<
``You killed this young woman in circumstances about which details are
extremely unclear. You then bound one of the young men in an extremely cruel
manner, gagging him and leaving him overnight.<
``The other young man came in and you bound them together and one was killed
in the sight of the other, then the other was killed and you walked out. There
their bodies lay because you did nothing to alert anybody until they were found
in sad circumstances six days later.''<
Mr Justice Blofeld added that Hobbs had appeared to show no remorse for the
``three apparently motiveless crimes''.<
