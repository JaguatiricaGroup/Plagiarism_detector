The man in charge of the investigation into the killings said the murders were
the ``most appalling'' he had seen in 29 years in the police.<
Detective Superintendent Trevor Davies of Thames Valley Police praised the
work of forensic experts and officers who had seen the carnage in the house.<
He said: ``I have 29 years experience in the force and I have never ever been
to a crime scene like this one. It was absolutely appalling.<
``It is difficult for someone like myself to understand what could possibly
have been going through Hobbs's mind. I don't know how anyone could be capable
of such callous and brutal acts.''<
He said the thoughts of all the officers who had worked on the case were with
the families of the three victims.<
And he said he shared the view of the judge in the case that Hobbs had not
shown any remorse for his actions.<
``Anybody who could murder someone and then stay and sleep in the house
overnight and prepare food could not have any remorse.<
``What the victim must have gone through knowing his girlfriend was dead a few
feet away beggars belief.''<
Det Supt Davies said the fact that Hobbs had been on drugs at the time of the
killings should not be used as an excuse.<
