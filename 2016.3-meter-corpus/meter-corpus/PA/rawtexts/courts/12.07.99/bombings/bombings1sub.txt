BOMBINGS COURT HEARING TOLD OF `FAX MESSAGE FINGERPRINTS'<
By Simeon Tegel, PA News<
Two Egyptian nationals appeared in court for the first time today in
connection with the bombing last year of two American embassies in Africa.<
Ibrahim Hussein Eidarous and Adel Mohanned Abdul Bary were both arrested in
London yesterday on United States extradition warrants.<
Bow Street magistrates court was told the pair conspired with the
international Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden and others to murder American
citizens.<
Arvinder Sambi, appearing for the Crown Prosecution Service on behalf of the
US government, said the two men's fingerprints were found on faxes claiming
responsibility for the bombings of the US missions in Kenya and Tanzania on
August 8 last year.<
More than 220 people died in the atrocities and thousands more were injured.<
Miss Sambi said one fax arrived at the Grapevine fax shop in London at 4.53am.
Another fax was then sent out following the bombings at 7.30am UK time from a
post office in Formosa Street in west London.<
Copies of both faxes were subsequently found at the offices of The Advice and
Reform Council, allegedly a front for the terrorist organisation Al Qade -
Arabic for The Leadership - in Beethoven Street in west Kilburn, London.<
Miss Sambi said: ``Mr Eidarous's fingerprints were found on the claims of
responsibility and were found prior to the bombings. Mr Bary's fingerprints were
on the fax that was sent.''<
Eidarous, 42, of Waldo Road in Harlesden, north west London, and Bary, 39, of
Randolph Avenue in Maida Vale, west London, were both remanded in custody for a
