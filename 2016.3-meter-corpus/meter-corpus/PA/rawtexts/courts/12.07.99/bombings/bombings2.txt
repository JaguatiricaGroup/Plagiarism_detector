Miss Sambi told the court that the pair were involved with Al Quadea, the
international council of bin Laden's well-financed terror group, which was bent
on Jihad - Holy War - against the US and the West, partly in revenge for the
Gulf War.<
``The council would have discussed and approved any major operations including
terrorist attacks,'' she said.<
``Al Quadea specifically targeted the US for a number of reasons. They
regarded the US as the infidel.''<
Under the Anglo-American Extradition Treaty of 1976, the US authorities have
60 days from the time of arrest to apply formally for the pair's transfer to
American jurisdiction.<
Miss Sambi asked for the men to be remanded in custody for 28 days.<
However, chief magistrate Graham Parkinson would allow only a week, saying he
wanted more information about the evidence against them from the US government.<
Mr Parkinson added that he was concerned by claims from Eidarous's lawyer,
Gareth Peirce, that her client - who was only released by British immigration
officers on Friday after a 10-month detention - was the subject of a
``Kafkaesque'' abuse of power by the US.<
Bary's lawyer Keith Hugo added that the CPS's objection to bail for his client
was based on a ``cocktail of surmise and sensationalised hypothesis''.<
Eidarous and Bary both appeared unfazed by the seriousness of the allegations
against them.<
Bary, bearded and portly in a beige suit and open-necked shirt, smiled broadly
when he entered the court. Eidarous was similarly dressed and also bearded, but
remained straightfaced throughout the hearing.<
Eidarous was described as a former army officer and Bary as a lawyer who now
helps fellow Egyptian dissidents. Both men were forced to leave their homeland
after allegedly being harassed by the authorities there.<
According to their lawyers, Eidarous lives in the UK with his wife and six
young children.<
Bary also lives with his family in Britain. His wife is expecting their sixth
child.<
