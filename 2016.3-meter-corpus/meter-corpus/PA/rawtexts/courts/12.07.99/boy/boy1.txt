BOY UNFIT TO STAND TRIAL FOR MURDER<
By Andrew Denholm, PA News<
A judge ruled today that a 13-year-old boy was mentally unfit to stand trial
for murder.<
Lord Caplan ruled that the youth would not have been able to understand court
proceedings or be able to conduct a proper defence at a hearing at the High
Court in Glasgow.<
``I have found that the accused is unfit to stand trial in view of his
insanity, using the term in the technical sense,'' he said.<
``The reason is that given the age of the accused and the disability from
which he suffers he would be unable to understand court proceedings or conduct a
full and proper defence on his own.''<
The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was accused of murdering
Charles McFall, aged nine, of Woodview, Viewpark, Uddingston, Lanarkshire, in
June last year.<
It had been alleged that, knowing there was petrol on the boy's clothing, the
youth set light to petrol near him and the boy was set on fire. He died in
hospital 15 days later.<
Last week defence counsel Gordon Jackson QC led evidence that the youth, who
was described as having a mental age of eight or nine, should not face trial
because he would be incapable of following the proceedings.<
Psychiatrists said he had special educational needs and that his physical and
emotional immaturity were immediately apparent.<
The Crown argued that the youth could have been fairly tried with enough
assistance including keeping sentences to 10 words and taking regular breaks.<
However, today Lord Caplan said he was not convinced that the high level of
support required to allow the child to proceed was practical.<
The preliminary diet adjourned until Friday to decide how to proceed.<
A public hearing will be held at some time in the future to establish the
facts of the case.<
