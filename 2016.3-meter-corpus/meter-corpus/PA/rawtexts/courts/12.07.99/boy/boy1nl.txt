MURDERED BOY'S PARENTS ATTACK `UNFIT' RULING ON ACCUSED, 13<
By Andrew Denholm, PA News<
The parents of a nine-year-old boy who died after he was doused with petrol
and set alight were devastated today after learning that no one will stand trial
for his murder.<
Libby and Charles McFall plan to appeal after hearing that a judge ruled that
the 13-year-old accused of killing their son Charles was mentally unfit to stand
trial.<
Charles died in hospital last year, 15 days after he suffered horrific burns
when his petrol-soaked clothes were set on fire.<
''We cannot take in the news, it is absolutely devastating and we just can't
understand it,'' said Mrs McFall, 39, of Bellshill, Lanarkshire. <
''Someone should be held responsible. It's not good enough just to say someone
is not mentally fit enough to stand trial _ where is the justice in that?''<
Mr McFall, 40, said they planned to fight the decision through the courts.<
``This is not the end of the matter, we are going to appeal this decision and
fight it all the way whatever it takes.''<
He said even the smallest child knows that petrol and fire are dangerous.<
The couple spoke out after Lord Caplan ruled in the High Court in Glasgow that
the accused child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was unfit.<
``I have found that the accused is unfit to stand trial in view of his
insanity. I use that in its technical sense,'' he said.<
``The reason is that given the age of the accused and the disability from
which he suffers he would be unable to understand court proceedings or conduct a
full and proper defence on his own.''<
Last week, defence counsel Gordon Jackson QC led evidence which suggested that
the accused boy had a mental age of eight or nine and had ``significant
intellectual deficiencies''.<
A psychiatrist said she felt the child was insane and unfit to plead in a
technical legal sense, not because of mental illness but because he would be
incapable of following court proceedings.<
However, evidence was also presented claiming that, with assistance such as
keeping sentences to less than 10 words and having regular breaks, the child
could understand sufficiently to instruct his lawyers.<
Lord Caplan said he was not convinced the high level of support required for
the child was practical. He adjourned the hearing until Friday for a legal
discussion on how to proceed.<
Under the current ruling a murder trial cannot be held but a public hearing
before a judge will take place to establish the facts of the case. At that stage
it will be up to the judge's discretion on whether to impose any sentence on the
child.<
