  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drummond was jailed for three months concurrently on each of six charges of
wilfully killing, taking and mistreating badgers.<
The charges related to two dead badgers and one live badger found on the
14,000-acre estate.<
Mr Ward said: ``It is obvious the badgers must have suffered a great deal.<
``One dragged a snare and hanged itself, and the other died when the snare,
which acts like cheese wire, cut through the skin of its neck.<
``I can see no reason for committing these offences because it did not seem
there was any threat to the estate.''<
The court had heard how two dead badgers caught in illegal snares were found
last April 20 yards from Drummond's home on the estate at Cark-in-Cartmel.<
One badger had suffered a particularly appalling death after dragging the
snare along until it hanged itself over a lime escarpment.<
Guy James, prosecuting, said the RSPCA had been contacted about the estate by
South Lakes Badger Group member Harry Stables.<
While searching the estate, they also found a live badger caught in a snare -
it was released back into the wild after treatment - and dozens of skulls and
carcasses of badgers.<
Mr James said the RSCPA found 20 self-locking snares on the estate.<
David Williams, defending, said Drummond had been devastated by the
conviction.<
He had lost his job which he, his father, sister and bed-ridden mother relied
on.<
Mr Williams said Drummond would now have to retrain as his reputation was
ruined.<
A spokeswoman for the RSPCA, who brought the case said: ``We are delighted
that the court has recognised that this was an extremely serious incident and we
hope it sends out a message to anyone that the killing of badgers is not
acceptable.''<
Dickon Knight, an agent for Holker Hall Estate, expressed his shock and
surprise at the sentence.<
Mr Knight said: ``Mr Drummond left by mutual agreement, and we are going to be
reviewing our procedures about snaring in the wood.''<
