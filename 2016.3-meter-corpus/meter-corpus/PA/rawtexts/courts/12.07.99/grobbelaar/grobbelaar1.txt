BID TO TRAP ASSOCIATE `MY WORST DECISION': GROBBELAR<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Former Liverpool star Bruce Grobbelaar told the High Court today that his lone
bid to trap an associate who wanted to involve him in match-fixing was ``the
worst decision of my life''.<
The 41-year-old goalkeeper said that he allowed former business partner Chris
Vincent talk to him about ``throwing'' matches when they met at a hotel in
October 1994 in an effort to get information he could take to the authorities.<
Mr Vincent had first made the suggestion the previous month when Mr Grobbelaar
agreed to meet to find out what had happened to his investment in an
unsuccessful games parks venture.<
``Chris Vincent came out with a bolt of lightning,'' he told Mr Justice Gray
and the jury in London.<
The sportsman said that Mr Vincent said he had met two men at Chester Races
who wanted to know if he was willing to throw games.<
``I told him he was bloody stupid - that nobody could ever do that. I was
shocked.''<
Mr Grobbelaar said that Mr Vincent said it would be an easy way to get back
the money he had invested.<
``I was flabbergasted. I thought about it again and thought why is he doing
this, what is he up to? Because in the past he had used my name to get money off
other people.''<
He said Mr Vincent rang him in October and again raised the possibility of
throwing games as they played snooker.<
``He was saying that there must have been some occasions when you could have
and I said `maybe' because I wanted to know what he was talking about and who he
was talking with.''<
He added: ``I was trying to get information out of him - I can see that it was
the worst decision of my life to go out on my own.<
``From African days I did everything myself - got myself to England on a
trial, got myself to Canada to play and Liverpool by myself - and this was one
of the reasons I went by myself.<
``I didn't tell anyone what I was doing. I thought I could handle it by
myself.<
``A plan was forming in my mind to get information about who his accomplices
were, get their names and addresses and then go to the authorities.''<
Mr Grobbelaar said that he shrugged his shoulders and replied ``maybe'' to Mr
Vincent's suggestions about the sums involved in match-fixing to ``draw him
out''.<
Mr Grobbelaar is suing The Sun and its former editor Stuart Higgins for libel
over a series of ``match-fixing'' articles which appeared in November 1994.<
These claimed that he took #40,000 to make sure Liverpool lost to Newcastle
the previous year and had blown his chance of thousands more in a game against
Manchester United by accidentally making a sensational save.<
The newspaper denies libel and is set to argue justification and qualified
privilege during the month-long hearing.<
