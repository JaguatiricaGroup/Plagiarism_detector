GROBBELAAR DENIES HE'D `LIE AND LIE' FOR CASH OR CONVENIENCE<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Soccer star Bruce Grobbelaar today denied that he was the kind of man who
would ``lie and lie and lie again'' to save his skin or obtain money.<
The former Liverpool and Southampton goalkeeper agreed with George Carman QC,
for The Sun - which Mr Grobbelaar is suing for libel - that he had lied about
his relationship with businessman Richard Lim.<
But, he insisted to Mr Justice Gray and the jury, it was ``not intentional''.<
He said that he was concerned that his relationship with Lim - for whom, he
said, he only provided football forecasting and information - would be in breach
of FA rules and affect his career.<
The 41-year-old sportsman is suing the newspaper over a series of
``match-fixing'' articles which appeared in November 1994.<
These alleged that he took #40,000 to make sure Liverpool lost to Newcastle
the previous year and had blown his chance of thousands more in a game against
Manchester United by accidentally making a sensational save.<
The newspaper denies libel and is set to argue justification and qualified
privilege.<
The civil action comes after two criminal trials at Winchester Crown Court in
1997 - the first of which ended in deadlock - which resulted in Grobbelaar being
cleared of conspiracy, along with ex-Wimbledon stars John Fashanu and Hans
Segers, and Mr Lim.<
Mr Grobbelaar denied Mr Carman's suggestion that he knew that Mr Lim was ``an
agent for a high-rolling betting syndicate in the Far East''.<
He agreed that he originally told the newspaper's reporters in November 1994
that he had not had any dealings with Mr Lim - or ``the short man''.<
Mr Carman: ``That was a lie.''<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``Yes - to them.''<
Mr Carman said that in July 1995, in High Court documents replying to the
newspaper's case, Mr Grobbelaar was telling the same lie that Mr Lim did not
exist.<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``I did not intentionally lie about that - the reason is
because of the FA rules.''<
Mr Carman went on: ``I would suggest to you that the position is that you are
the kind of man unfortunately who will lie and lie and lie again if it suits
your own convenience either to save your skin or obtain money.''<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``Mr Carman, I think that is untrue and I think that is a very
bad accusation.''<
