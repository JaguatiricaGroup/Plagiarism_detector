               14:17 12/07/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Grobbelaar
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grobbelaar was questioned by his counsel Richard Hartley QC about a conversation
in Mr Vincent's hotel bedroom after the snooker, which unknown to the goalkeeper
was being video taped by The Sun.<
Counsel asked him why he had made remarks during that conversation about
throwing football matches.<
Grobbelaar told the court: ``I made those remarks to try and get Mr Vincent's
confidence. I needed to get his confidence to find out who he was working
with.''<
But he said there was ``no truth'' in anything he had said to Mr Vincent.<
He said he was lying to Mr Vincent and ``bragging'' to him to get his
confidence to obtain information to go to the authorities.<
``Everything on the tape is a complete lie,'' he told the jury.<
Mr Hartley asked him why, during a later taped conversation, he had agreed to
become involved in the match-fixing scheme Mr Vincent was putting to him.<
Grobbelaar repeated that it was to gain Mr Vincent's confidence in the hope
that he would tell him the names of others involved. He had also accepted #2,000
from Mr Vincent for the same reason.<
Grobbelaar said he would then have had evidence to give to the authorities
``and say he has already paid me this money''.<
The money was kept in the locked glove compartment of his car. It was later
given to his solicitors.<
Grobbelaar denied ever trying to lose a match: ``I always try my best for my
side.''<
