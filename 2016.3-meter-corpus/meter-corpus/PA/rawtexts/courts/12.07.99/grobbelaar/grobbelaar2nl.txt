  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Grobbelaar also denied that he had lied in court documents about a midnight
trip from Norwich to the London Park Lane Hilton in February 1994 to see Mr
Lim.<
He reject Mr Carman's assertion that he was ``desperate'' to keep Mr Lim out
of the picture, as though he did not exist, until evidence gathered by the
police for the criminal proceedings proved their connection.<
Mr Carman suggested that Mr Grobbelaar was ``sufficiently immoral'' that he
was prepared to present a false case to the High Court and to The Sun until he
was forced to change his story by the police investigation.<
Mr Grobbelaar said that was not true.<
``I put those statements in because, at the time, I thought it would be bad
for my reputation. I didn't intentionally do it to deceive any court
proceedings,'' he said.<
Earlier Mr Grobbelaar agreed with Mr Carman that his naming of acquaintances
John Fashanu and Richard Lim as conspirators in the match-fixing during a
conversation with former business partner Chris Vincent - which was secretly
videotaped by The Sun - was ``a dishonourable thing to do''.<
But he said he had done so to make his story ``credible'' in a bid to get
information from Mr Vincent which he could pass on to the authorities.<
He had wanted to gain Mr Vincent's confidence and had decided to bring in a
footballer and someone he knew from the Far East to make his story
``credible''.<
Mr Grobbelaar said: ``In retrospect it was not the best thing I have done in
my life.''<
Mr Carman put to him: ``You are telling the jury that you lied about these two
men who were friends, blackening their character, all to try and establish some
sort of credibility with Mr Vincent?''<
Mr Grobbelaar replied: ``That's right.''<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
end<
