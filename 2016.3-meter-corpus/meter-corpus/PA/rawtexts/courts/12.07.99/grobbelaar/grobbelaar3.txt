  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Grobbelaar said that he was at Gatwick to fly to Zimbabwe in November 1994,
just before the articles appeared, when two reporters from The Sun subjected him
to a ``barrage of questions and innuendoes''.<
He realised he had been set up by Mr Vincent when he was shown a photo of
Vincent giving him #2,000.<
``My head was just swimming because they were coming at me from all angles,''
he said.<
He knew the story would not do anything for him in Britain or for his
marriage, and he was concerned.<
He spoke to the reporters and their editor on the phone because he realised he
had put himself ``in a very grave position'' and needed to put his side of the
story before the paper went to print.<
``I was shell-shocked - it was a devastating blow,'' said Mr Grobbelaar.<
``That story was going to go right around the world - as it did.<
``People who are very good friends of mine actually said that I was going to
find out how many friends in true life I really had got.<
``It still has got a reaction now because a lot of people give you a little
bit of a jive about what happened.''<
Asked how he felt about the newspaper's continuing justification of its
story, he referred to his acquittal at Winchester Crown Court in 1997 - after
the first trial ended in deadlock - which resulted in him being cleared of
conspiracy.<
``After going through two criminal trials and being found not guilty I feel
that they carry on doing these stories - if it's not me, it's going to be
someone else,'' he said.<
He added: ``I've never thrown a game in my life.''<
Mr Hartley: ``Have you ever tried?''<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``Never, ever.''<
