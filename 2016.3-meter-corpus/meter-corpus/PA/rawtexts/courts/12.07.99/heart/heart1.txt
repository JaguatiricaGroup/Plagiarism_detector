NHS `CAVALIER' AHEAD OF BABY-HEARTS SCANDAL, INQUIRY TOLD<
By Allan Smith, PA News<
Bristol hospital doctors did nothing illegal in retaining children's hearts
and other organs after they died in complex heart operations, a hospital chief
said today.<
But Mr Hugh Ross, chief executive of the United Bristol Healthcare Trust,
admitted the NHS generally had been ``cavalier'' in its attitude in seeking
consent for the retention of tissues after post-mortem examinations.<
Mr Ross, the Trust's chief from 1995, said new guidelines were introduced
recently to reinforce a sympathetic and informed approach in such cases.<
He told the Public Inquiry into the Bristol baby-heart scandal that the law
was unclear on retention of tissue and had been the subject of debate for
years.<
He added: ``If I think back over a number of years it would not be unfair to
say that the NHS handled this issue in a somewhat cavalier manner in the distant
past.<
``I think the practice has been far too slow to change and, although there was
discussion over the years, the practice has not moved as fast as it might have
done. Informed consent was not the order of the day which clearly it should have
been.''<
A week before the multi-million pound investigation began in March, the
Bristol Heart Children's Action Group claimed the Trust had systematically
retained children's hearts and other organs without the parents' knowledge.<
The group believes as many as 180 children could have been buried with organs
missing after complex cardiac operations and the Inquiry is to hear from a
number of distressed parents about how they learned the truth.<
