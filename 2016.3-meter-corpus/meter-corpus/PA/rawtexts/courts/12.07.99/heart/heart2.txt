  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Ross agreed with the Inquiry's leading counsel Brian Langstaff QC, that
parental consent was not required if a coroner ordered a post mortem.<
It WAS needed if a hospital carried out the post mortem and later retained
organs for research or teaching purposes.<
Mr Ross said he had ordered a review of practice in Bristol, leading to new
guidelines on consent, and he maintained the guidelines reinforced good current
practice in his hospitals.<
He added: ``It was recognised that NHS practice was right for review and ripe
for overhaul and now in all our dealings with patients and relatives we
increasingly try to give much better information about what it is we intend to
do for the patients' benefit.''<
He was referred to an August 1992 letter from Trust pathologist Dr Jem Berry
to surgeon Janardan Dhasmana dealing with the law on tissue retention.<
It pointed out that organs should not be held unless there was a signed
statement from the doctors concerned that the parents had no objections.<
Mr Dhasmana, in reply, admitted there had been ``some oversight'' on his part
in discussing matters with parents. The surgeon said that on some occasions
consent had not been taken by his junior staff.<
Mr Ross was referred to a February 1999 report which showed that 85% of post
mortems in his Bristol Hospital were carried out on behalf of the coroner and
15% carried out by the hospital.<
He said the figures showed a trend towards an increased reduction in hospital
post mortems.<
The public inquiry follows a long-running General Medical Council probe into
the scandal.<
The GMC investigation examined 53 Bristol Royal Infirmary operations in which
29 patients died and four were left brain injured.<
It ruled that surgeon James Wishart and Dr John Roylance, the Trust's former
chief executive, should be struck off.<
Mr Dhasmana was banned from operating on children for three years.<
The Public Inquiry is examining the management and care of children undergoing
heart operations at the BRI during the 12 years up to 1995.<
