Mr Ross said that by November 1998 he knew that around 180 hearts had been
kept.<
Although he had later discussions with the Bristol Children's Heart Action
Group, he had not disclosed this figure as they were not the only group of
relatives involved over the issue.<
He told Mr Langstaff that he had been ``surprised to learn of the scale of the
problem''.<
