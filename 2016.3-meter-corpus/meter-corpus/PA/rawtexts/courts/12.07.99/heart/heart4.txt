Mr Ross later told the Inquiry he believed there were 179 cases of retention
of hearts, lungs or other tissue during the period under investigation.<
But he added that the total number of cases uncovered by the Trust's probe was
around 300 _ with some cases going back as far as the 1960s.<
He said he did not make the 179 figure public in November 1998 because he
wanted to ensure the parents concerned were first individually informed of the
situation regarding their children's organs.<
He told the Inquiry that the Royal College of Pathologists was about to
circulate new guidelines on retention which, he hoped, would spur a review of
current legislation to clarify the obligations of the NHS and individual
practitioners.<
He criticised national reporting on the issue and stressed the Bristol
hospitals had done nothing illegal _ a situation confirmed by the Department of
Health.<
The Trust, he added, would continue to review its practices and had arranged
for closer liaison with coroner's officers to make sure their decisions were
handled sensitively and that relatives were kept fully informed.<
