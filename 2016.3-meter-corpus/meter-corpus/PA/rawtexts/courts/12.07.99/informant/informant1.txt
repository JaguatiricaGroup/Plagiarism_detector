CPS MAN `SOLD INFORMATION TO GANGSTERS' _ COURT TOLD<
By Paul Peachey, Crime Correspondent, PA News<
An official at the heart of Britain's justice system passed sensitive
information to one of the nation's most feared criminal families, a court was
told today.<
Lowly administration officer Mark Herbert allegedly used his position at the
Crown Prosecution Service to copy details of criminal cases and names of 33
informants for the London-based Adams family in return for #1,000.<
He copied details from computerised files and passed them to a nightclub
bouncer who in turn gave it to one of the family's key lieutenants, Victor
Temple QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Luton Crown Court.<
He said: ``The Adams family together with their associates had formed
themselves into a formidable and feared organisation steeped in the highest
levels of criminal activity.<
''The organisation was no stranger to the imposition of serious violence
against those who might seek to challenge them and few could afford to trifle
with their wishes.''<
Herbert, a policeman's son, told officers after his arrest that he was even
pressed for details about the school attended by the daughter of a key CPS
lawyer.<
The jury was told that Herbert, 31, was in debt and forced to moonlight as a
nightclub bouncer in addition to his #14,000-a-year post at the CPS headquarters
at Ludgate Hill, central London.<
He was taken on at Options nightclub by Kevin Sumer, who once worked in a club
run by the Adams', Mr Temple claimed.<
He said Sumer soon learned, through Herbert's bragging, that he worked for the
central casework division of the CPS dealing with some of the biggest criminals
in Britain.<
Mr Temple said: ``One of the most sensitive and difficult areas of the Crown
Prosecution Service work at Ludgate Hill last year concerned the Adams family
and their associates.''<
He said Herbert, of Twickenham, west London, knew details of the investigation
into the Adams family which centred on three brothers - Tommy, Terry and
Patrick.<
Mr Temple said his ``arrogance and greed were to get the better of him'' as he
passed details through documents or word-of-mouth to Sumer, 41, who grasped the
lucrative opportunity.<
The jury was told that Sumer, of Brentford, west London, met Billy Isaacs, his
best man and Adams' lieutenant, at Heston Services on the M4 on August 13 last
year.<
Officers from the National Crime Squad had the pair under surveillance and saw
Sumer carrying a plastic bag which they believed held the documents about the
Adams investigation.<
Inside the service station, they were heard talking about Tommy and Terry
Adams and Isaacs was eventually seen leaving with the bag, according to Mr
Temple.<
The next month, the pair met again at Heston services and were overheard
complaining about the speed with which Herbert handed over information.<
It was the same month that Tommy Adams went on trial in a drugs case where he
pleaded ``Guilty'' and was sentenced to more than seven years in prison.<
Herbert and Sumer are jointly charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of
justice and both face one charge each of corruption.<
Herbert is also accused of two counts of disclosing information without lawful
authority and Sumer is accused of aiding and abetting Herbert on the same
charges.<
