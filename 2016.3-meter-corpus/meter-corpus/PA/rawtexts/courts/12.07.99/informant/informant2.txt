  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The prosecution claims that at the end of last September Herbert went through
computer databases at the CPS and wrote down the 33 informants' names.<
Herbert told police later that he met Sumer and gave him the names and he got
an unsuspecting colleague to type two copies up for him.<
When Sumer was arrested a few days later, the copies were found inside his
Land Rover Discovery.<
Mr Temple said: ``The Crown alleges that both copies were destined for onwards
transmission.''<
On October 1, two undercover policemen posing as Adams' associates approached
Herbert near his home and said they were concerned that details were not coming
through quickly enough.<
He allegedly told them: ``I have got a list of all the majority of the grasses
in the country.''<
He was given #1,000 by the pair, calling themselves Ted and Gary, but he was
arrested soon afterwards by other officers.<
Mr Temple said that Herbert later recognised the seriousness of passing
informants' names.<
``They will send them flowers but not possibly for their birthdays,'' he
allegedly said during police interviews.<
Herbert claimed he felt trapped and feared that either he or his girlfriend
would be killed if he did not co-operate. He said it became like feeding a
``ravenous dog'' but said he had received only two lots of #500 from Sumer which
he had spent on girlfriend Sian Williams.<
Mr Temple said: ``Herbert is saying, `yes I admit I passed on this
information, I admit that I knew it was confidential, I knew that I was doing
wrong but I was acting under duress'.''<
