TEENAGE LOVERS LEFT `FORGIVE US' SUICIDE NOTE<
By Lisa Salmon, PA News<
Two teenage sweethearts who could not bear to be apart killed themselves after
leaving a note saying ``please forgive us,'' an inquest heard today.<
Leanne Elveck, 16, and Damien Kilburn, 19, who had a ``very close and loving
relationship'' were found dead in a car in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, last
March.<
An inquest in Wakefield heard that the couple believed Damien was going to
prison and felt their situation was ``hopeless''.<
Damien, a car valet, was found by a neighbour in the reclined front seat of
his Ford Escort, which had a hosepipe leading from the exhaust.<
Leanne, who had been seeing Damien for two years, was found under a duvet in
the backseat of the car.<
Three notes and a half empty bottle of vodka were discovered in the vehicle,
although tests later revealed that neither had drunk a large amount of alcohol.<
Sergeant Ian Froggett told the inquest that the suicide was ``tragically
mutual,'' adding that the note suggested: ``It was helplessness and they did not
want to be separated. They were apologising at the suggestion of doing this.<
``They did not want to be separated and couldn't bear to be apart.''<
Mr Froggett said he did not know whether Damien would have gone to prison.<
Recording a verdict of suicide West Yorkshire coroner David Hinchliff said
that the notes were very detailed and suggested the couple acted jointly. The
couple's family refused to comment after the inquest.<
It was not stated in court what charge Damien might have faced, but it was
believed to involve a minor offence.<
