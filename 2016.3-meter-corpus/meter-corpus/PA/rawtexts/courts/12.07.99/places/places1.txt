LABOUR ACCUSED OF `SHAMEFUL BROKEN PROMISE ON EDUCATION'<
By John Aston, PA News<
The Government was today accused of the ``shameful'' breaking of promises to
allow children to keep their assisted places at private schools.<
The accusation came after a mother lost a High Court test case which could
affect as many as 1,500 pupils who are currently pupils in the junior
departments at private schools which provide education up to the age of 18.<
The children are victims of a Government policy decision that, save for
exceptional cases, they will now lose their funding when they complete their
primary education.<
This is due to the phasing out of the assisted places scheme, which provides
public funding for bright children from low income families wanting to attend
private schools.<
Today the legality of the policy was challenged by Mrs Rachel Begbie, of
Ridley Hall, Cambridge, whose 11-year-old daughter Heather has an assisted place
at St Faith's, the junior part of The Leys School, Cambridge.<
She accused the Government, in particular Education Secretary David Blunkett,
of breaking post pre-election and post-election promises that pupils in her
daughter's position would keep their assisted places until the age of 18.<
But Mr Justice Maurice Kay, sitting in London, ruled that such promises were
``irrelevant'' and Mr Blunkett, when in Government, was bound by policy at the
time.<
To decide otherwise would be to interfere with his statutory duty, said the
judge.<
But he said it was ``a sorry state of affairs'' when Mr Blunkett ``has to
explain away his own letters as mistaken and unclear and a statement by the
Prime Minister as an incorrect representation of policy, taken out of
context''.<
Conservative education spokesman James Clappison, MP for Hertsmere, said
later: ``The general conduct of the Government is shameful. Ministers should be
ashamed of themselves for failing to keep the pre-election promises given to the
parents of these young children.''<
