JUDGE CRITICISES LABOUR OVER ASSISTED PLACES PLEDGES<
By John Aston, PA News<
Education Secretary David Blunkett was today criticised by a High Court judge
for a ``sorry state of affairs'' which means that young children face losing
their assisted places at private schools.<
Prime Minister Tony Blair was said to have made an ``incorrect representation
of policy'' that places were safe up to the age of 18, the judge stated.<
The criticisms came as Mrs Rachel Begbie, of Ridley Hall, Cambridge, lost her
test case claim that her 11-year-old daughter Heather was entitled to rely on
both pre-election and post-election promises that her education would not be
disrupted as the Government set about dismantling the assisted places scheme for
bright children from modest backgrounds.<
Mr Justice Maurice Kay, although critical of Labour's handling of the affair,
ruled that any promises which might have been made were not legally binding.<
The judge said Mr Blunkett was entitled to adopt a policy of withdrawing
assisted places funding for children at the ``natural break'' between their
primary and secondary education, even at private ``through schools'' which
provided education up to 18.<
The ruling affects some 1,500 pupils in the junior departments at private
schools.<
The judge agreed with Mr Blunkett's lawyers that ``pre-election promises are
irrelevant'' and a Secretary of State was ``not bound by what was said by
himself or others in opposition''.<
A Secretary of State was also ``entitled to change policy'' and the law gave
him ``a very wide discretion which it would be inappropriate and unlawful to
fetter'', ruled the judge.<
But the judge said it was ``a sorry state of affairs'' when Mr Blunkett ``has
to explain away his own letters as mistaken and unclear and a statement by the
Prime Minister as an incorrect representation of policy, taken out of
context''.<
Mr Blair told the press in February 1998 that ``no child currently at private
school under the scheme who has already got a place has lost out. They will be
able to continue their education''.<
After today's ruling, Conservative education spokesman James Clappison, MP for
Hertsmere, said: ``The general conduct of the Government is shameful. Ministers
should be ashamed of themselves for failing to keep the pre-election promises
given to the parents of these young children.''<
Mrs Begbie, who was given permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal,
said that the judge's ruling would effectively end the hope of further
Government funding for her daughter and five others at St Faith's, the junior
part of The Leys School, Cambridge.<
Asked how her daughter felt about what had happened, she said: ``How would any
11-year-old feel, having been out of the state sector for two years, to be told
she has got to move when all her friends are staying on?''<
A senior Government source declined to comment on the judge's remarks about Mr
Blunkett.<
But the source added: ``Throughout the entire process of phasing out the
assisted places scheme in order to provide money to reduce class sizes, we have
sought to ensure that we have been as fair as possible at every stage in the
process.''<
A Department for Education and Employment spokesman said officials had looked
at 340 applications for discretion under the appeals scheme, and had granted
184.<
