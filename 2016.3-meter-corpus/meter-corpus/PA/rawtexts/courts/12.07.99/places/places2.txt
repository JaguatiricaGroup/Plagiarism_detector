The judge was told that Heather's education was in difficulties when she
attended a failing state primary.<
In 1997 she won a place at St Faith's, with the expectation that she would
move to the senior school in the autumn term 2001 to continue her ``all
through'' education there until she was 18.<
Philip Engelman, appearing for the family, told the judge that the Labour
Party, before the May 1997 election, announced plans to abolish the assisted
places scheme.<
But it promised during the phasing-out period not to disrupt the education of
individual pupils who already had places.<
Assurances were given that children already at the secondary level could
complete their private education, while those at free-standing prep schools
could finish their primary education at 11 or 13 before losing their funding.<
A Labour Party official told Mrs Karen Cutler, the mother of another child
with an assisted place, that where a pupil had an offer of a place for September
1997 at an ``all through'' school that place would be honoured through to the
age of 18 if Labour was elected.<
Similar statements were made to other parents.<
Following Labour's election win, the scheme was abolished with effect from
September 1997.<
But the Prime Minister told the press in February the following year ``no
child currently at private school under the scheme who has already got a place
has lost out. They will be able to continue their education.''<
Education Secretary David Blunkett wrote to grandparent Mrs B Teed in March
1998 stating that where there had been ``a clear promise'' of a place at an
``all through'' school ``we have agreed to honour that promise''.<
In March last year, Mr Blunkett also wrote to Mrs Begbie saying that
undertakings given during the passage through Parliament of the Bill phasing out
the assisted places scheme ``will be met''.<
But Mrs Begbie was then told her daughter's place would not be funded after
she completed her primary education at the end of the current school year.<
In October last year Mr Blunkett decided not to exercise his discretion to
allow Heather to remain at The Leys.<
Mr Engelman argued that decision was ``irrational and unreasonable'' and
breached the European Convention of Human Rights.<
But the judge agreed with Mr Neil Garnham, appearing for the Department for
Education and Employment, who argued the Government had been following a lawful
policy, as set out in a September 1997 letter, and there had been no illegality,
irrationality or unfairness.<
Mr Justice Kay said that, although the letters of reassurance sent to Mrs Teed
and Mrs Begbie ``do the Secretary of State no credit'' they did not provide a
legal platform for a successful application for judicial review.<
The Government, when announcing its decision to abolish the assisted places
scheme, argued that the move would release #100 million to reduce class sizes
for all five, six and seven-year-olds in state primary schools to a maximum of
30.<
