A senior Government source declined to comment on the judge's remarks about Mr
Blunkett.<
But the source added: ``Throughout the entire process of phasing out the
assisted places scheme in order to provide money to reduce class sizes, we have
sought to ensure that we have been as fair as possible at every stage in the
process.<
``There have been hundreds of individual letters received on this issue and
throughout, we have introduced a very fair system where we have honoured
election pledges fully.<
``We have introduced an appeal system where individual parents are able to
appeal if changing school at age 11, which is the usual age of transfer for most
children, would have an adverse impact.''<
It is understood that more than half of those appeals have been decided in
favour of parents.<
