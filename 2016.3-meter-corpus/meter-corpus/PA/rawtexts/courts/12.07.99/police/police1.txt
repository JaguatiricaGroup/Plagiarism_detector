`I WAS HOUNDED OFF THE MET' _ BLACK WPC CLAIMS<
By Athali Matthews, PA News<
A black Wpc who served in a flagship community relations unit has told an
employment tribunal how she suffered sexual and racial discrimination and
victimisation from colleagues.<
Andrea Ffrench, 34, told the tribunal in Croydon, south London, that she
believed her immediate superior in the Metropolitan Police force, Sergeant
Vernon Allen, had sabotaged her work at the Lambeth Youth and Community Office.<
She claimed Sgt Allen, who is white, humiliated her in front of colleagues and
made racist comments.<
She is bringing her case against the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul
Condon as well as Inspector Chris Dale and Chief Inspector Dalton McConney, who
is of Afro-Caribbean origin.<
Mrs Ffrench told the hearing that Sgt Allen was ``bullying, overbearing and
unnecessarily aggressive'' and made frequent reference to his racist beliefs,
making her feel uncomfortable.<
She also believed he hid files needing her urgent attention in her filing
cabinet so that she would appear incompetent.<
She claimed her treatment led to her being prescribed anti-depressants and
suffering crying outbursts and sleeplessness until she retired last January on
grounds of ill-health after 11 years on the force.<
Mrs Ffrench said that Sgt Allen victimised her by kepping a log of her work,
entering comments in a red book which was later found by a member of staff.<
She described how on one occasion Sgt Allen had nodded when she accused him of
hating her and longing to see the back of her. <
Mrs Ffrench went on to say she believed her annual appraisal had been doctored
between October 1997 and May 1998.<
Detective Inspector David Michael, a founder member of the Black Police
Officers' Association, said the case ``flies in the face of the message that the
Met is seriously working towards an anti-racist police force''.<
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ``The counsel for the
commissioner will seek to show that in some instances Andrea may have been over
sensitive and unreasonable in her interpretation of what may be explained as
normal management activity.''<
The case was due to continue on Wednesday.<
