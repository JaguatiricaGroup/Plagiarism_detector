HANGED PC INDULGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY, INQUEST TOLD<
By Mark Benattar, PA News<
A police officer who was found by his wife hanged and wearing women's clothing
had probably been indulging in sexual activity which went fatally wrong, an
inquest was told today.<
An accidental death verdict was recorded on Pc Andrew Gibb, a 35-year-old
father-of-two, who died from strangulation, caused by a ligature.<
He was found dead by his wife at his home in Rufford, near Orsmkirk,
Lancashire.<
Pc Gary Sander, who was called to the address last month, told the Ormskirk
hearing that a neighbour cut the rope that had been tied to the banisters.<
Questioned by coroner Howard McCann, he agreed that the dead man appeared to
have been involved in some sort of sexual activity that went wrong.<
Mr McCann said it was not a deliberate attempt at self harm, but a process of
trying to apply pressure that had gone too far.<
He added: ``Unfortunately it is a type of case that does occur from time to
time.''<
Pc Gibb was based at Eaton Road police station in West Derby, Liverpool.<
Chief Inspector Stuart Eckford, also based at Eaton Road, said: ``Colleagues
and friends are extremely shocked and saddened by the death of Andy Gibb.<
``Andy had served as a constable for 16 years and particularly at Eaton Road
for the last eight years. In addition to his normal uniform duties, he had
become the Constables' Federation representative and was heavily involved in
health and safety issues in the area.<
``He was a fine officer and well respected by all that worked with him. He
will be missed. At this time our thoughts go out to his family.''<
