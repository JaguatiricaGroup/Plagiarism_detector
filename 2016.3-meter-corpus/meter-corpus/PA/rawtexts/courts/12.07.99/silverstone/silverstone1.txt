NAVY MAN KILLED DURING RACE TRACK PRANK<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
An inquest was opened today into the death of a Royal Navy officer at the
Silverstone motor racing circuit.<
Petty Officer Ian Chambers, 35, of Salisbury, Wilts, died when an MGF sports
car crashed on the Northamptonshire track during what is thought to have been a
late-night prank ahead of Sunday's British Grand Prix.<
His body was cut free from the wrecked vehicle but he was pronounced dead at
the scene. A post-mortem gave the cause of death as traumatic asphyxia caused by
crushing.<
The car, carrying four members of a Navy Sea King helicopter crew, sped on to
the circuit on Friday night but spun off and flipped over into a gravel trap
between Vale and Club corners.<
The three other occupants crawled free and were treated at Northampton General
Hospital.<
The driver, a 32-year-old man from Culdrose barracks in Helston, Cornwall, was
arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and released on police bail.<
Northamptonshire coroner Anne Pember adjourned the inquest until a later
date.<
