BOUNCER JAILED FOR KILLING DRUG DEALER<
By Chris Court, PA News<
A nightclub bouncer who strangled a drug dealer and hid the body in a toy
chest under his daughter's bed was jailed for five years today.<
Bodybuilder Philip Adrian Hicks, 31, was acquitted by the jury at Exeter Crown
Court of murdering 29-year-old John Wickens in Taunton, Somerset, in August last
year. But he was convicted of manslaughter.<
Prosecutor Stuart Jones QC, had told the court that 17 stone Hicks, of
Franklin Close, Taunton, had ``throttled'' Mr Wickens to death.<
Hicks, who had borrowed his ex-wife's home in Taunton to hold the meeting with
Mr Wickens, said he grabbed the other man in a headlock after he pulled a gun,
then he ``went limp.''<
Mr Justice Butterfield said he was satisfied it was not a planned or
premeditated killing.<
``Something happened which led you in some way to lose control and kill him,''
said the Judge.<
But he added that he did not accept Hicks had given an honest account of his
dealings with Mr Wickens.<
Mr Jones said it was not until the morning after the killing that 6ft 6ins
Hicks told his ex-wife Michelle that the body was still under the bed of their
daughter Sophie, then nine.<
Michelle, Sophie and their six-year-old son Curtis had spent the night away
from her house in Fletcher Close, Taunton, Somerset, where the murder took
place.<
When she returned next day, said Mr Jones, Hicks told her that the previous
night's meeting had gone wrong, saying: ``I have killed him,'' adding: ``I tried
bringing him back but I could not.''<
``I was going to put him in the attic but I could not lift him up,'' he told
her.<
Police found the body of Mr Wickens in the toy chest under the child's bed,
said Mr Jones.<
