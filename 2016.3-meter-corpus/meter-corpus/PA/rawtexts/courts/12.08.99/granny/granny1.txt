PROBATION FOR GRANDMOTHER WHO STABBED DAUGHTER'S VIOLENT LOVER<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
A white-haired grandmother walked free from the Old Bailey today after she
admitted attacking her daughter's violent lover with a knife.<
Norah Pollard told police afterwards: ``I just wanted to kill him. I do not
want him near my Sharon or her babies.''<
Pollard, 57, from Greenwich, south east London admitted unlawfully wounding
Darren Lambert last January and was put on probation for two years. She said she
was relieved it was all over as she left court.<
Her daughter, Sharon, had a ``long standing but highly acrimonious''
relationship with Lambert. There had been several incidents of domestic
violence, Marks Moore, prosecuting, told the court.<
Lambert was jailed for three months after he dragged Sharon, 28, along a
balcony and bit her 100 times in August, 1998.<
But on his release he ``provocatively'' moved into a flat below where Sharon
was staying with her mother. He harassed her and made threatening phone calls.<
On January 24, Mrs Pollard confronted him on his doorstep.<
``She walked forward and lunged at him with a large black handled kitchen
knife. He protected him and received a cut to his hand,'' said Mr Moore.<
It required four stitches and caused no permanent damage.<
Mrs Pollard came from a large and devoted family, but had a history of alcohol
abuse, the court heard.<
The Recorder of London, Judge Michael Hyam, told Pollard there were a ''great
many mitigating factors which enable me to impose a probation order.''<
It was perfectly plain her motive was anger over the way Lambert ill treated
her daughter, he said.<
``That was your viewpoint. I understand that, but it does not justify what you
did.<
``I am satisfied you feel very sorry for what you did and realise you should
not have done it.''<
He made it a condition of probation that she received treatment and advice for
her alcohol problem.<
