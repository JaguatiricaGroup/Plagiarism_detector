ENGLISH VERSUS SCOTS RACISM CASE DUE IN COURT<
By Andrew Denholm, PA News<
An English couple who allege they were the victims of racial discrimination
while living in a Scottish village were due to go to court today in a bid to
claim #20,000 compensation.<
Frank Walters, 51, and his wife Sandra, 52, who moved to Scotland for a
peaceful retirement, say they were forced to leave their home because of their
nationality.<
The couple were scheduled to appear at Dumfries Sheriff Court in an action
alleging unlawful discrimination under the Race Relations Act.<
The couple were suing publican Colin Pearson and his postmistress wife
Jacqueline, alleging they were barred from the local pub and post office.<
Mr Walters was seeking #10,000 from the publican for barring him from the pub
and refusing him the services of the post office and also claiming #5,000 from
Mrs Pearson. Mrs Walters was also suing Mr Pearson for #5,000.<
  The case was set to go ahead today after an appeal to suspend the hearing
was thrown out by Sheriff Principal Graham Cox.<
Mr and Mrs Pearson had asked for a suspension until the outcome of a similar
case involving rugby commentator Mark Souster against BBC Scotland.<
Englishman Mr Souster claims a racial motive was to blame for his failure to
get a job, but an appeal has been lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.<
The couple, now living in Cumbria after moving out of the tiny village of
Clarencefield, near Annan, last June, have been backed by the Commission for
Racial Equality.<
They also claim they faced racial abuse and were shown placards bearing the
words ``English Out''.<
They say that even before receiving a solicitor's letter barring him from the
pub, Mr Walters, a former assembly worker at Ford's Halewood plant in
Merseyside, was given the cold shoulder and on one occasion Flower of Scotland
was played 16 times on the pub jukebox.<
The Pearsons' solicitor John Lawson said the case was about personalities not
nationalities.<
