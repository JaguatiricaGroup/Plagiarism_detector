ENGLISH VERSUS SCOTS RACISM CASE SETTLED<
By Andrew Denholm, PA News<
A battle for compensation by an English couple who claimed they were the
victims of racial discrimination whilst living in a Scottish village ended today
when lawyers reached an out of court settlement.<
Frank Walters, 52, and his wife Sandra, 53, said they had been vindicated with
the undisclosed settlement, believed to be a four figure sum in the region
#4,000 plus costs estimated at #40,000.<
However the settlement, at Dumfries Sheriff Court, admits no liability on the
part of the defenders publican Colin Pearson and his post mistress wife
Jacqueline.<
Mr and Mrs Walters, who moved to Scotland from Liverpool 12 years ago, claimed
they were forced to leave their home because of their nationality.<
They had started proceedings to sue Mr and Mrs Pearson for a total of #20,000
alleging they barred them from the Farmers Arms pub and adjoining post office in
the village of Clarencefield near Annan, Dumfrieshire.<
Their action alleging unlawful discrimination under the Race Relations Act was
backed by the Commission for Racial Equality.<
