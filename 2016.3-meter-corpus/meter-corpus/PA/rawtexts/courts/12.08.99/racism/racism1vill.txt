VILLAGERS SUPPORT COUPLE ACCUSED OF ANTI-ENGLISH RACISM<
By Andrew Denholm, PA News<
The outcome of the case astonished residents of the tiny village of
Clarencefield, half of whom are English.<
No one could be found today with a bad word to say about publican Colin
Pearson and his postmistress wife Jacqueline.<
Douglas Green, 80, who has lived in the village, population just 130, for 40
years said the Pearsons were a ``lovely couple'' who were always friendly to
their customers whatever their nationality. <
``It's incredible that this has happened.<
``I am English as are many other residents and we have never heard so much as
a word said against English people from other people in the pub. It's just a
joke.''<
Across the road from the pub, Imelda Shephard, 56, said the Pearsons were a
popular couple who were at the heart of the community life of the village and
had never shown any malice to anyone.<
``This is absolutely dreadful to think that their livelihood could be put in
jeopardy in this way. They're a friendly couple and you won't find anyone here
who've got a problem with them.''<
Another resident, who asked not to be named, said that if Frank and Sandra
Walters had been discriminated against in any way the whole village would have
been up in arms.<
``This is a very small community and people tend to know each other's business
and talk of anti-English racism is simply nonsense. This has got nothing to do
with racism, if anything it's about personalities or more accurately
attitudes.''<
