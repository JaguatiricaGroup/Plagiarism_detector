            14:08 12/08/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Racism Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Lawson, solicitor for Mr and Mrs Pearson, said: ``Both sides have settled
out of court on the basis of economic factors rather than matters of principle
or indeed nationality.<
``It should be reiterated that Mr and Mrs Pearson have not admitted any
liability, they have not racially discriminated against anyone.<
``It should also be borne in mind that the pursuers in this case were subject
to heavy financial backing by the Commission for Racial Equality.<
``Mr and Mrs Pearson were funding the matter themselves out of their own
pocket and that has been a prime consideration.''<
Mr Lawson said Mr Pearson's father was English, from Birmingham, and that he
had ``not a molecule of anti-English sentiment in his body''.<
Speaking outside court after the settlement Mr Pearson said: ``We are glad
that the action is now over, I would like to thank everyone who has sent us
messages of support. It has been a stressful period.''<
