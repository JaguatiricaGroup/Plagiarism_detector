Mr and Mrs Walters said they were extremely happy with the settlement and
insisted the issue was one of nationality.<
``It was just a small few who made our lives a misery and it mustn't happen to
anybody else, that's why this case was brought,'' said Mrs Walters.<
``Scottish people are the best people in the world, we have lived here a long
time and they are wonderful. It is just a small few.''<
She said she and her husband, who has a heart condition and confined to a
wheelchair, wanted to move back to Scotland to enjoy their retirement.<
In the action Mr Walters, originally from Liverpool, sued the publican for
#10,000 for allegedly barring him from  his pub and refusing him the service of
the post office and was also claiming #5,000 from Mrs Pearson. Mrs Walters, who
was born in Chester, also sued Mr Pearson for #5,000.<
The couple, now living in Longtown, Cumbria, after living in Scotland for 12
years after a move from Frodsham, near Chester, claimed they faced racial abuse
and that Mr Walters was barred from the pub because he was English after an
argument over a pool tournament.<
They said that he was given the cold shoulder and that on one occasion the
song Flower of Scotland was played 16 times on the pub juke box.<
A spokeswoman from the Commission for Racial Equality said: ``We are pleased
to state that the parties have agreed an out of court settlement between them
without admission of liability on the part of the defenders.<
``In all the circumstances Mr and Mrs Walters have found the whole case very
stressful and now look forward to a quiet retirement.''<
