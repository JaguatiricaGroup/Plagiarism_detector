TEENAGE RAPIST TO BE SENTENCED<
By Jon Coates, PA News.<
A teenager was today due to be sentenced for raping a widow in her own bed.<
Gareth Reader, 18, of Crown Quay Lane, Sittingbourne, denied the rape but was
convicted by a jury after a four-day trial at Maidstone Crown Court.<
The court heard how the 37-year-old victim was subjected to a terrifying
ordeal when a hooded man appeared at the end of her bed in her Maidstone home.<
He wielded what looked like a bar and told her he wanted sex, before ordering
her to undress and raping her repeatedly.<
Before leaving he threatened to come back and cut her up if she reported the
attack.<
Judge Anthony Balston delayed sentencing until today for a psychiatric
assessment of Reader, but warned him that a custodial sentence was inevitable.<
