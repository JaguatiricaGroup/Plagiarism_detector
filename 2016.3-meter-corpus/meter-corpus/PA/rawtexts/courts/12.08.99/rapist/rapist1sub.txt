TEENAGER SENTENCED FOR RAPING WIDOW IN HER BED<
By Jon Coates, PA News<
A teenager was today sent to a young offenders' institution for ten years for
raping a widow in her own bed.<
Gareth Reader, 18, of Crown Quay Lane, Sittingbourne, had denied the rape but
was convicted by a jury after a four-day trial at Maidstone Crown Court in
July.<
The court heard that the 37-year-old victim was subjected to a terrifying
ordeal after a hooded man, apparently armed with an iron bar, appeared at the
end of her bed at her home in Maidstone, Kent.<
After repeatedly raping her, he threatened to come back and cut her up if she
reported the attack, but the victim alerted a neighbour within minutes and the
police were called.<
After his arrest, Reader gave a sample of hair and his DNA profile was found
to match that of the rapist, obtained from semen left behind on the bedsheet.<
The court was told the chances of the DNA profile being that of someone else
were one in a million. Reader, who was 17 at the time of the offence, denied
ever being in the woman's home and chose not to go into the witness box.<
After his conviction, the court heard he had previous convictions for assault,
damaging property, and two robberies, the earliest dating from when he was just
15.<
Judge Anthony Balston had delayed sentencing until today for a psychiatric
assessment of Reader, but had warned him a custodial sentence was inevitable.<
In sentencing he said: ``The reports show you are a continuing danger to women
and they must be protected from you for a long period of time.<
``You showed no mercy to the victim and put her through a horrendous
ordeal.''<
