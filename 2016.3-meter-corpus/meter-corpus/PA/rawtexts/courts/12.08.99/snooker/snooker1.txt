ACCUSED BLACK OFFICER `SUFFERED YEARS OF RACIST ABUSE'<
By Paul Peachey, PA News<
The black female police officer accused of attacking a male colleague with a
snooker cue had endured years of racist abuse and taunting about her sex life, a
court heard today.<
Pc Joy Hendricks was asked what underwear she wore and about her private life
on her first full day on a new police team, she told the court.<
Officers on the Territorial Support Group based at Caledonian Road, north
London, made lewd comments about women and had obscene names for black people,
she told Horseferry Road Magistrates Court. <
When officers on the team saw a black and white man together they called them
a ``salt and pepper team'' and described other blacks as ``groids'', short for
``negroids'', she said.<
Pc Hendricks, 34, is accused of hitting Sergeant Mark Workman with a snooker
cue as they waited to go on a drugs raid.<
She claimed she punched him once in self defence after accusing him of calling
her ``dodgy'' and ``Stevie (correct) Lawrence Two''.<
She said other members of the TSG considered her a ``dozey plonk'' while she
served on the team between 1989 and 1994, two years after joining the
Metropolitan Police.<
She said: ``I was asked by one of the guys did I have a boyfriend, did I go
out with white guys, what sort of underwear did I wear ... <
``Basically it went down from there. <
``If they saw a woman it would be `I would give her one, look at the size of
her tits.' It's all about a woman's shape, and with me it's always about my
shape, my figure, my looks.<
``You did have a few who were the main leaders of them, and then you have a
few that didn't participate, but they didn't stop it.<
``Somebody had to be a victim ... I was an easy target.''<
She claimed the force got `two for the price of one' when she went on the TSG
crew because she was a token black woman.<
When she complained about one officer she was `sent to Coventry' by others
including Sgt Workman who was also serving on the TSG, she said.<
Despite being moved to another crew, the abuse continued and she said she
needed counselling and her marriage broke up under the strain.<
She told the court that after five years she moved to Operation Welwyn, a vice
unit based at Islington, north London, where things improved.<
But in September 1998 members of the TSG group including Sgt Workman gathered
at Islington to prepare for a drugs raid.<
More than 30 officers gathered in the canteen after a briefing and when she
walked past Sgt Workman's table, she claimed that he said: ``There's a lot of
dodgy people around here.'' <
