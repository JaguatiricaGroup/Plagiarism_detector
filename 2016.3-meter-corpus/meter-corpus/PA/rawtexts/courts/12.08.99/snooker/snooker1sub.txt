BLACK OFFICER CLEARED OF SNOOKER CUE ATTACK ON COLLEAGUE<
By Paul Peachey, Crime Correspondent, PA News<
The Metropolitan Police was today thrown into a fresh race controversy after a
black policewoman was cleared of attacking a senior colleague with a snooker
cue.<
Pc Joy Hendricks said she had suffered years of racist and sexual
discrimination at the hands of her colleagues before she decided to take action
against the latest slur.<
Sergeant Mark Workman claimed that the 35-year-old punched, scratched and hit
him with a snooker cue as they waited to go on a drugs raid.<
But stipendiary magistrate Eleri (correct) Rees said she was ``troubled'' by
another policeman's evidence during the two-day trial and found Pc Hendricks not
guilty.<
A delighted Miss Hendricks said outside Horseferry Road Magistrates Court,
central London: ``I am very, very relieved.<
``I think this is obviously going to open a whole can of worms and hopefully
the Metropolitan Police Service will investigate all the previous allegations I
made that were ignored.''<
