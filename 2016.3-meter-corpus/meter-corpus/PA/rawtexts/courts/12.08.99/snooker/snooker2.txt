                 13:37 12/08/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Snooker
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pc Hendricks said she felt angry, upset and humiliated, and kept thinking about
everything that had happened while she was on the TSG.<
``On the TSG you were treated as furniture,'' she told the court. ``He has got
a job to protect people like me.''<
She said she was furious at what she said was harassment, and said she could
not believe he ``had the front to talk to me as if he was a bully on the
street.''<
She decided not to endure bullying any more and claimed she went to seek out a
senior officer to complain.<
But she walked into a snooker room where Sgt Workman was with another officer,
and she said she demanded an apology.<
She is accused of punching, kicking and scratching him during three attacks,
having to be pulled off by the other officer.<
But she claimed that she only punched him once, and in self defence.<
She also accused Sgt Workman of colluding with the other officer, Pc
Christopher Blair, and claimed that Sgt Workman inflicted injuries upon himself.
<
The court had been told that Sgt Workman had scratches on his neck and head,
and had an epaulette ripped from his shirt. <
She also told the court that she compiled a 110-page complaint to the Police
Federation in 1995, but was told to forget about it because the officers would
all deny it and she was too late for an industrial tribunal. <
During a cross-examination by Alun Milford, prosecuting, she admitted that not
all the officers on the TSG were bad. <
Pc Hendricks, who is based at Islington, denies common assault.<
