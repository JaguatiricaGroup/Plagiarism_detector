  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pc Hendricks told the court that on her first full day with a north London-based
Territorial Support Group, a colleague asked her questions about her sex life in
front of male officers.<
She detailed how officers on the team based at Caledonian Road had obscene
names for black people and made lewd comments at passing women.<
She was asked if she would go out with a white man and questioned about what
underwear she wore, Pc Hendricks told the court.<
The officer, who is currently on sick leave, said the constant abuse meant she
lost her confidence, needed counselling and her marriage broke up under the
strain.<
But a series of witnesses on her behalf described her as a talented officer
whose only ambition was to work in the Met and serve the public in London.<
She claimed that Sgt Workman called her ``dodgy'' and later ``Stevie Lawrence
Two'' while they were waiting to carry out an operation.<
She claimed she acted in self-defence after suffering five years of abuse from
colleagues, including Sgt Workman, while on the TSG.<
Her lawyer, Lincoln Crawford, who is also the chairman of the Race Relations
Committee of the Bar, said: ``I think it was obviously a sensitive matter for
the police and I think the outcome is a very good one.<
''I think we ought to learn lessons from this. We have got a long way to go
notwithstanding all the efforts made post-Lawrence. It still shows in the lower
ranks of the police that there is a long way to go.<
``I am sure they will succeed but we can't be complacent about the amount of
work we need to do.''<
