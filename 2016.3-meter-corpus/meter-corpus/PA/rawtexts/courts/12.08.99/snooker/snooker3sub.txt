           15:50 12/08/99: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Snooker Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pc Hendricks said other members of the TSG team called her a ``dozy plonk'' and
ostracised her when she complained about one officer who was picking on her.<
She left the team in 1994 and went to work on Operation Welwyn, a vice unit
based in Islington, where matters improved.<
But Mr Crawford said that her past came back to haunt her in September 1998
when the TSG team was deployed on a drugs operation.<
A group including Sgt Workman had gathered in the canteen at Islington after a
briefing and as she walked past, she said she heard him say: ``There's a lot of
dodgy people around here.''<
Feeling angry and humiliated, she went to complain to a senior officer but
encountered Sgt Workman later in the snooker room playing with Pc Christopher
Blair.<
A row ensued and she claimed she landed only one punch but Sgt Workman said
she repeatedly punched, scratched and struck him with a snooker cue during three
attacks.<
The magistrate: ``It's not for me to make judgments about the Metropolitan
Police.''<
She added: ``Despite the large number of witnesses called by the prosecution
the reality is that only three people can say what happened in that snooker room
that night.''<
Because of the difference in accounts between the two officers, the magistrate
said she was looking to the third officer for an objective view of what
happened.<
But she said: ``However his account left me troubled.<
``At the end of the day it's for the prosecution to make me sure that she was
not acting in self-defence and it has failed to do so.''<
