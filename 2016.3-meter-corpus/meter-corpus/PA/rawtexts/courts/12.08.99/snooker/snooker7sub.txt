The chairman of the Black Police Association, Leroy Logan, said the case
highlighted how much work still had to be done to eradicate racism from the
service.<
He said: ``As an association we are delighted with the outcome of the case
against Joy Hendricks.<
``It stresses that people who are victims of racism have a duty to stand up
and fight for their rights. Joy Hendricks could have remained quiet and it would
have continued against her.<
``It also highlights division within the ranks in respect of racism in that
higher ranks seem more prepared to put their heads above the parapet and we
acknowledge their input in this case.<
``However, the lower ranks appear to exhibit a culture of blind loyalty that
still prevails and inhibits people speaking out as they should.''<
