NEW AGE TRAVELLER LOSES DAMAGES CLAIM<
By Damien Brook, PA News<
A New Age traveller today lost a claim for compensation against a driver who
crushed him as he lay in front of her car while his friends attacked her.<
Roger Gedge, 30, of Arnold, Nottingham, lost a leg and suffered horrific
injuries in the incident in July 1994.<
He claimed the driver of the car, Sarah Field, 27, from Cheltenham, had been
negligent and unreasonable when she drove off with him trapped under her red
Ford Mondeo.<
But today at Nottingham County Court, Recorder Iain McLaren ruled against Mr
Gedge.<
He said: ``Nothing that Mrs Field did could be regarded as failing to take
reasonable care in the circumstances.''<
The accident happened as Mrs Field and her then husband drove into a free
concert at Nottingham's Wollaton Park.<
Their car was surrounded by Mr Gedge and several friends who had been drinking
strong lager and cider for much of the day.<
The court heard that they became abusive and started banging on the car
windows and jumping on the bonnet of the vehicle.<
During the attack, Mr Gedge was seen to crawl in front of the car and lay
against the front wheels.<
When Mrs Field saw what she thought was an opening past her attackers, she
accelerated away, the court heard.<
Recorder McLaren said: ``I accept the evidence that this woman, who was 22 at
the time, was terrified by this incident and sought to escape.<
``Why should she be disbelieved when she says that she thought this group were
going to kill her.''<
He said that as she accelerated away the front wheels of the car crushed Mr
Gedge's pelvis. He then became trapped between the rear wheel and the wheel
arch.<
Mrs Field drove to what she thought would the sanctuary of some of the event
marshals - around 300 metres from the original incident.<
She had earlier told the court that it was only when she and her husband got
out of the car that they saw what had happened.<
On the question of whether Mr Gedge had contributed to his own injuries and
therefore shared the blame, Recorder McLaren said: ``Either he was intending to
be crassly stupid or he wanted to stop the car so that his colleagues could
further attack the car.''<
He added: ``One has to sympathise with any man who has suffered such injuries,
but English law provides him with no claim.''<
Leave to appeal against today's finding was refused.<
Speaking from her Cheltenham home after the decision Mrs Field said: ``It is a
brilliant result. My feelings are of complete disbelief that he even brought the
case - I cannot understand on what grounds he thought he was going to
succeed.''<
She added that she no longer considered a car a place of safety and often felt
vulnerable and intimidated by crowds.<
Mr Gedge said he was not disappointed by today's decision and that he thought
it had been a worthwhile case to bring.<
It is estimated the insurance company will be left with a bill of around
#15,000 from the action while the public will have to pay up to #50,000.<
