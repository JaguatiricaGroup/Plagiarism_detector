BA FACES #13M FINE IF GUILTY OF `UNFAIR TRAVEL DEAL'<
By Geoff Meade, European Editor, PA News in Brussels and Alex Richardson<
British Airways faces record fines today for paying travel agents to steer
passengers on to its flights at the expense of rival carriers.<
The retiring Commissioner for competition policy, Karel Van Miert, is
understood to be intent on making an example of BA to jolt other EU
flag-carrying airlines operating identical incentive schemes.<
A maximum fine of #13 million can be imposed for ``serious'' breaches of EU
rules on abusing a dominant position in the marketplace. But the penalty could
go higher if Brussels decides the duration and scale of the offence makes it a
``very serious'' case.<
The ruling is the culmination of an inquiry triggered by two formal complaints
from BA's long-haul arch-rival, Virgin Atlantic.<
Virgin said BA was offering travel agents extra commission if they could
demonstrate that the national carrier's ticket sales were going up compared with
rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.<
Richard Branson's airline alleged that the incentive scheme was designed to
put maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier
in the market, regardless of price, quality of service or scheduling.<
The pressure was stepped up every year, it was claimed, with travel agents
concerned that their commission would fall unless they maintained the required
annual sales growth target for tickets.<
The Commission sent a warning letter to BA last year insisting the scheme was
illegal, as EU law prohibits the use of restrictive contracts to reinforce a
dominant market position.<
BA's response was a new scheme _ the ``performance rewards scheme'' _ which
triggered a second complaint from Virgin.<
BA, which is expected to appeal, has argued that it is being targeted
unfairly, as other leading European airlines operate similar incentive schemes.<
But Brussels says it has no plans at the moment to launch new inquiries into
the activities of the rest.<
A spokesman for Virgin said: ``If the decision goes in our favour it will
vindicate everything we have said, and also sound the death knell for British
Airways current sales arrangements.<
``More to the point it should lower fares for customers by allowing us to
compete on a level playing field.''<
He said: ``As a smaller airline we can only compete with BA on a limited
number of routes.<
``We might offer a better deal across the Atlantic, but travel agents are
forced to use BA because of the incentives offered on the whole of their
network.<
``Our argument is that by offering travel agents and corporate clients these
incentives BA is unfairly using its position in the market place.''<
Last night a spokeswoman for BA said: ``This is still subject to the
Commission's inquiry, and we are waiting for its ruling.<
``Clearly it would be wrong for us to comment before the Commission announces
its decision.<
``Our arrangements with travel agents are similar to those of most major
airlines across Europe.''<
The Commission is currently investigating the sales arrangements of nine
European airlines, including BA, but today's ruling is understood to relate
solely to Virgin's complaint against the British company.<
