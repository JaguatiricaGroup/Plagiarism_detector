BA FINED #4M OVER SWEETENERS TO TRAVEL AGENTS<
By Peter Woodman and Geoff Meade, PA News<
British Airways was today fined #4 million for breaching European competition
rules after complaints from Richard Branson's airline, Virgin Atlantic.<
The European Commission said BA had illegally provided cash incentives to
travel agents to boost ticket sales at the expense of rivals.<
Mr Branson said the ruling would ``mark the death knell for BA's
anti-competitive sales incentive arrangements and should lead to lower fares''.<
But BA said it would appeal against the decision, which it branded ``wrong in
fact and in law''.<
Imposing the penalty, EC competition commissioner Karel van Miert stopped
short of imposing a maximum fine of #13 million for what were described as
``serious'' breaches of EU rules on abusing a dominant position in the
marketplace.<
The ruling was the culmination of an inquiry triggered by two formal
complaints from Virgin.<
Virgin had accused BA of offering travel agents extra commission if they could
demonstrate that the national carrier's ticket sales were going up compared with
rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.<
Virgin alleged the incentive scheme was designed to put maximum pressure on
travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier in the market,
regardless of price, quality of service or scheduling.<
The pressure was stepped up every year, it was claimed, with travel agents
concerned that their commission would fall unless they maintained the required
annual sales growth target for tickets.<
The Commission sent a warning letter to BA last year insisting the scheme was
illegal.<
BA's response was a new scheme _ the ``performance rewards scheme'' _ which
triggered a second complaint from Virgin.<
The EC discovered that for at least seven years BA had been offering travel
agents extra commission payments if they met or exceeded their previous year's
sales of BA tickets.<
The Commission said today the incentives were ``clearly illegal'' and that the
practices BA engaged in had prevented UK air travellers from benefiting fully
from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe.<
BA and Brussels have now sorted out a way forward to prevent the airline
continuing any preferential treatment for travel agents and the Commission
called on other airlines to voluntarily adopt the same standards _ a clear
warning of more fines to follow if they do not.<
BA director for sales Dale Moss said: ``Our commission arrangements for travel
agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and across the
world.<
``This company's policy is to give travel agents a chance to earn more
commission by selling more tickets.''<
He went on: ``This is normal business practice. It also means that agents can
sell more cheaply to consumers if they wish.<
``The airline industry is fiercely competitive. Passengers have more choice
than ever before. If we are to be restricted then we look forward to the EC
establishing a level playing field by ensuring that the rules are applied
equitably to all airlines.''<
 Mr Branson said: ``This is a vindication of Virgin's complaints that BA has
been abusing its dominant position.<
 ``For a long time, BA has had the travel trade trapped in the bearhug of
their monopolistic control of the British airline markets.<
``The travel trade will now be free to give independent impartial advice to
travellers and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the
pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets.''<
The Consumers' Association welcomed the EC decision.<
Patricia Yates, editor of the association's Holiday Which? magazine said BA's
actions had ``hit at the heart of a competitive aviation market''.<
But she added: ``The size of the fine indicates, BA is not the only dominant
carrier using its marketing clout to squeeze out smaller carriers.<
``We trust that the Commission will, as BA itself has suggested, take similar
action against other big European carriers.<
``We would also like to see the Commission extend this approach on directed
selling to include the package travel sector.<
