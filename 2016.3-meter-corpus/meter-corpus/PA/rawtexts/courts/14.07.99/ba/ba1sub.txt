BA FINED #4m OVER `UNFAIR TRAVEL DEAL'<
By Geoff Meade, European Editor, PA News<
British Airways was today fined #4 million for breaching EU competition
rules.<
The European Commission said BA had illegally provided cash incentives to
travel agents to boost the carrier's ticket sales at the expense of rivals.<
The retiring commissioner for competition policy, Karel Van Miert, imposed the
penalty to make an example of BA and jolt other EU flag-carrying airlines
operating similar incentive schemes.<
But he stopped short of imposing the maximum fine of #13 million for
``serious'' breaches of EU rules on abusing a dominant position in the
marketplace.<
The ruling is the culmination of an inquiry triggered by two formal complaints
from BA's long-haul arch-rival, Virgin Atlantic.<
Virgin said BA was offering travel agents extra commission if they could
demonstrate that the national carrier's ticket sales were going up compared with
rival carriers, particularly when selling to corporate clients.<
Richard Branson's airline alleged that the incentive scheme was designed to
put maximum pressure on travel agents to give preference to the largest carrier
in the market, regardless of price, quality of service or scheduling.<
The pressure was stepped up every year, it was claimed, with travel agents
concerned that their commission would fall unless they maintained the required
annual sales growth target for tickets.<
The Commission sent a warning letter to BA last year insisting the scheme was
illegal, as EU law prohibits the use of restrictive contracts to reinforce a
dominant market position.<
BA's response was a new scheme _ the ``performance rewards scheme'' _ which
triggered a second complaint from Virgin.<
BA, which is expected to appeal, has argued that it is being targeted
unfairly, as other leading European airlines operate similar incentive schemes.<
