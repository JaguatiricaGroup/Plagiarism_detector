Today's ruling was welcomed by Virgin Atlantic boss Richard Branson, who said:
``This is a vindication of Virgin's complaints that BA has been abusing their
dominant position.<
``This really will mark the death knell for BA's anti-competitive sales
incentive arrangements and should lead to lower fares, provided Virgin can in
future compete with BA on a route-by-route basis.<
``For a long time, BA have had the travel trade trapped in the bearhug of
their monopolistic control of the British airline markets.<
``The travel trade will now be free to give independent impartial advice to
travellers and offer the best deals on each route without having to meet the
pressures of BA's anti-competitive sales targets.''<
