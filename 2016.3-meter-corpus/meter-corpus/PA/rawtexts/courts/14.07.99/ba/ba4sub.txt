British Airways immediately announced that it would appeal against the ruling
which it branded ``wrong in fact and in law''.<
BA director for sales Mr Dale Moss said: ``Our commission arrangements for
travel agents are similar to those run by most major airlines in Europe and
across the world.<
``This company's policy is to give travel agents a chance to earn more
commission by selling more tickets.<
``This is normal business practice. It also means that agents can sell more
cheaply to consumers if they wish.<
``The airline industry is fiercely competitive. Passengers have more choice
than ever before.<
``If we are to be restricted then we look forward to the European Commission
establishing a level playing field by ensuring that the rules are applied
equitably to all airlines.''<
