  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commission officials have spent years looking into so called ``loyalty rebate''
schemes which effectively tie travel agents to a dominant airline.<
For at least seven years, the commission discovered, BA has been offering
travel agents extra commission payments if they meet or exceed their previous
year's sales of BA tickets.<
The commission said today: ``It is well established community law that a
dominant supplier cannot give incentives to its customers and distributors to be
loyal to it, so foreclosing the market from the dominant firm's competitors.<
``The effect of this abuse is to try to counteract the effect of market
liberalisation by maintaining the dominant airline's market share at its old
levels and by penalising travel agents who divert some of their customers to
relatively new competitors.<
``Incentives of this type given by a dominant firm are clearly illegal.''<
The commission said a firm like BA should only offer extra commissions to
travel agents if they reflect extra services provided by the travel agent.<
The practices BA engaged in had prevented UK air travellers from benefiting
fully from the effects of EU efforts to liberalise air transport in Europe.<
