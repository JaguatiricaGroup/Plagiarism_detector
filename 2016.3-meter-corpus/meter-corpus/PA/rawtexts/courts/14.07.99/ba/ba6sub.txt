                13:35 14/07/99: Page 6 (HHH) EU BA Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Consumers' Association welcomed the EC decision.<
Patricia Yates, editor of the association's Holiday Which? magazine added:
``The practice of dominant players rewarding travel agents for pushing their
tickets ahead of other airlines hits at the heart of a competitive aviation
market.''<
She went on: ``However, as the size of the fine indicates, BA is not the only
dominant carrier using its marketing clout to squeeze out smaller carriers.<
``We trust that the Commission will, as BA itself has suggested, take similar
action against other big European carriers.''<
Ms Yates added: ``We would also like to see the Commission extend this
approach on directed selling to include the package travel sector.<
``Consumers of package holidays are very often directed toward the product
that the firm wants to sell rather than the product that the consumer wants to
buy. We look forward to action in this area.''<
