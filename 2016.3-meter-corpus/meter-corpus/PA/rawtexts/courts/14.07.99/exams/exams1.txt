TEENAGER HANGED HIMSELF OVER EXAM GRADES FEAR<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
A ``lively and likeable'' teenager hanged himself because he feared he would
not get the grades he needed in his GCSEs, an inquest heard today.<
Anthony Alderman, 16, was found by his mother hanged by a rope in a loft space
at his home in Welbeck Avenue, Aylesbury, Bucks, on May 6 this year.<
Coroner Richard Hulett, recording a verdict of suicide, said there was an
``irony'' in the fact that Anthony had been expected to get ``reasonable
grades''.<
The inquest at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury heard that Anthony had
left The Grange School in Aylesbury at break time on the day of his death,
telling fellow students he had not done his homework for the next lesson.<
Pupil Billy-Jade Banks, 15, said in a statement read to the court: ``I
remember Anthony saying to us he was going home as he hadn't done his English
homework. He didn't seem bothered by it.<
``He said he wasn't coming back to school. That was the last time I saw
Anthony alive.''<
Anthony's mother Sharon found him when she came home from work at a doctor's
surgery at lunchtime. He had written two notes explaining in detail why he had
taken his life.<
Mrs Alderman said she was not aware of Anthony having any problems with his
school work but said he had spoken of being ``humiliated'' by one of his
teachers.<
Mr Hulett said that the notes, which Anthony had written, told of how he felt
he had wasted his future.<
He said: ``He goes on to relate to the fact that he thinks that he has
effectively wasted his education up to this stage and says that he won't get the
grades he requires to do the type of job he would like to do.<
``There is a certain irony in that the reports from the school say that,
although one or two bits of coursework were a bit late, in most cases he was
predicted to achieve reasonable grades and is described everywhere with
affection as a lively and likeable member of his year group.<
``The truth of the matter appears to be that he gave not a clue of the
desperate state of his mind.<
``He was wrong in his estimation of himself, though unfortunately to say that
now is no good whatsoever.''<
