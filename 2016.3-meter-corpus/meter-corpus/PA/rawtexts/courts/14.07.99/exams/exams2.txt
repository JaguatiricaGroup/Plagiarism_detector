EXAM PRESSURE CONTRIBUTED TO SHY TEENAGER'S DEATH - CORONER<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
A ``painfully shy'' public schoolgirl hanged herself in her room on the eve of
her A-level exams, an inquest heard today.<
Yolanda McPherson, 18, was discovered hanging from the back of her door at
Stowe School, Bucks, by a cleaner.<
Coroner Richard Hulett, recording a verdict of suicide, said the pressure of
exams probably contributed to Yolanda's decision to kill herself, but that it
was only one of many possible factors.<
Yolanda, who was in the sixth form at the #15,000-a-year school, was found at
about 10am on April 30 by a cleaner at Lyttelton House who had been unable to
get into her room.<
Chloe Cherry eventually pushed the door ajar to find the teenager hanging from
a scarf on the back of the door.<
She called school bursar Helen Jackson, a trained first-aider, who cut the
scarf with scissors and tested Yolanda's pulse.<
A post-mortem examination concluded that Yolanda died from hanging.<
Her housemistress, Jane Hamblett-Jahn, told the inquest that Yolanda, of
Wootton, near Bridgnorth, Shropshire had even taken to occasionally drinking to
boost her confidence.<
She said: ``Yolanda was painfully shy and quite unable to join in the friendly
banter in the classroom.<
``She lacked confidence, had low self-esteem and was sometimes quite clingy
with her friends.''<
Yolanda had been to the school sixth form bar on the night before her death
and had had a ``difficult'' conversation with her boyfriend, but was not drunk,
Miss Hamblett-Jahn added.<
She said Yolanda, who was due to sit exams in English, History and Art, was
``disorganised'' and had been under-achieving at school.<
School reports said her social life had become her main priority at the
expense of her work.<
Mr Hulett said: ``This was a young woman who was not very willing to confide,
and for that reason it is very difficult to judge what was truly on her mind.<
``I feel sure she had an awareness that she had not made the best of the
opportunities at school and had not applied herself. I can't help but feel that
that was a factor.''<
Headmaster Jeremy Nichols said after the inquest at Stoke Mandeville Hospital,
Aylesbury, Bucks: ``Yolanda's tragic death devastated our community.<
``Although shocked and deeply saddened by the event, staff and pupils united
strongly as a community to cope with their grief and the challenge of getting on
with their lives and their exams.<
``I am very proud of the way they have handled a most tragic situation.''<
Yolanda's parents are divorced. Her mother Elizabeth attended the inquest but
left without comment. Her father now lives in Mexico.<
