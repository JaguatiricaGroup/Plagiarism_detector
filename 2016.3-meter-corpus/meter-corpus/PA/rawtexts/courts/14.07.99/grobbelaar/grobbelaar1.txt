GROBBELAAR ACCUSED OF `MOVING THE GOALPOSTS'<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
The Sun today accused former soccer star Bruce Grobbelaar of ``moving the
goalposts'' by playing with the truth in his evidence to the High Court jury
hearing his libel action against the newspaper.<
Facing his third day of cross-examination by George Carman QC, the former
Liverpool, Southampton and Zimbabwe goalkeeper was taken back to a video-tape,
secretly filmed by The Sun in October 1994.<
In it, Mr Grobbelaar, 41, talks about match-fixing with former business
partner Chris Vincent.<
Mr Grobbelaar said details he gave of a Far East betting ``handicap'' system
allegedly used by the people behind businessman Richard Lim were in fact nothing
to do with Mr Lim but an invented ``spice'' to make his story credible to Mr
Vincent.<
His knowledge of such systems was legitimately gathered from playing trips to
the East, he told Mr Justice Gray in London.<
Mr Carman asked: ``You are a goalkeeper who keeps moving the goalposts don't
you? In the sense that you are playing with the truth in the witness box and
trimming your answers to fit in with any new facts presented to you.''<
Mr Grobbelaar responded: ``That's simply not true.''<
Asked about a trip with Mr Vincent to the Manchester Hilton to see Mr Lim in
September 1993, Mr Grobbelaar denied its purpose was to collect payment for
match-fixing.<
He said Mr Lim had wanted to see the business plan for the Mondoro game parks
venture, in which he and Mr Vincent were involved, although _ unknown to him at
the time _ Mr Vincent had no such plan.<
Mr Carman put it to Mr Grobbelaar that this was ``another invention'' to which
he replied that the meeting had nothing to do with match-fixing, although Mr Lim
did give him #1,500 on that occasion for football information he had provided.<
He said Mr Lim, described as a ``football groupie'', would use the
goalkeeper's expertise on a team's strengths and weaknesses so he could
formulate his own betting forecast.<
At that time, added Mr Grobbelaar, he didn't know the information would be
used for gambling.<
Mr Carman's suggestion that this was another invention was ``simply not
true''.<
Mr Grobbelaar is suing The Sun over a series of articles which appeared in
November 1994. These alleged that he took #40,000 to make sure Liverpool lost to
Newcastle the previous year and had blown his chance of thousands more in a game
against Manchester United by accidentally making a sensational save.<
The newspaper denies libel, claiming justification and qualified privilege.<
The civil action comes after two criminal trials at Winchester Crown Court in
1997. The first ended in deadlock _ which resulted in Grobbelaar being cleared
of conspiracy, along with ex-Wimbledon stars John Fashanu and Hans Segers, and
Mr Lim.<
