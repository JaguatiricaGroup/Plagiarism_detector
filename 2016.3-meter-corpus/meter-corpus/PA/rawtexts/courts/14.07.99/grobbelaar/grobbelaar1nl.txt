SUN ACCUSES GROBBELAAR OF BID TO PERVERT JUSTICE<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
The Sun today accused Bruce Grobbelaar of attempting to pervert the course of
justice in his High Court libel action over match-fixing allegations.<
The newspaper's QC, George Carman, concluded his third day cross-examining the
former Liverpool and Southampton star by saying that his whole story was
``riddled with lies and evasion and deviousness''.<
``That is simply not true,'' replied the 41-year-old goalkeeper, who is suing
the tabloid over a series of articles which appeared in November 1994.<
They alleged that he took #40,000 to make sure Liverpool lost to Newcastle the
previous year and had blown his chance of #125,000 more in a game against
Manchester United by accidentally making a sensational save.<
The newspaper denies libel, claiming justification and qualified privilege.<
The civil action comes after two criminal trials at Winchester Crown Court in
1997 - the first ended in deadlock _ which resulted in Grobbelaar being cleared
of conspiracy, along with ex-Wimbledon stars John Fashanu and Hans Segers, and
businessman Richard Lim.<
Mr Carman said that, when first confronted by The Sun, Mr Grobbelaar had lied
about whether ``the short man'' - as Mr Lim was known - existed and carried on
with the lie for eight months in the High Court proceedings.<
Confronted with the newspaper's defence, he added, Mr Grobbelaar had gone on
``formal record'' saying that ``the short man'' was a figment of his
imagination.<
Grobbelaar: ``I did - yes.''<
And, pressed the QC, he lied about a midnight trip to London to see Mr Lim and
going to north London to see John Fashanu at his home.<
Grobbelaar: ``Yes, and I've given my reason.''<
The Zimbabwean has told Mr Justice Gray and the jury that he did not
intentionally deceive, but was concerned that a relationship with Lim, for whom
he says he provided only football information, would be in breach of FA rules
and affect his career.<
Carman: ``At that stage in this action, the very action from which you are
claiming damages from this jury, you were lying in an attempt to pervert or
interfere with the course of justice, weren't you?''<
Grobbelaar: ``No.''<
