               13:51 14/07/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Grobbelaar
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Carman suggested that the reason given by Mr Grobbelaar for making a
four-hour round trip at night between Norwich, where his team was playing the
following day, to the Hilton Hotel in London's Park Lane to see Mr Lim in
February 1994, was a ``pack of lies''.<
Mr Grobbelaar said he travelled to the hotel with Mr Vincent because Mr Lim
had been making enquiries for him about the possibility of playing in the Far
East as he was worried about his Liverpool career.<
 At that meeting Mr Lim paid him #1,500 which Mr Grobbelaar said was for
football information.<
Mr Carman pointed out that Mr Grobbelaar had lied to a team mate at their
hotel in Norwich about where would be after 9pm that night and then went to
London, arriving at around midnight and did not get back to Norwich until about
3am.<
Mr Carman put to him: ``The position in truth is that if you only wanted to
know what he had found out in the Far East, whether there was any chance for
you, all that could have been done on the telephone, even from Norwich.''<
Mr Grobbelaar replied: ``This is the first meeting with Richard after he came
back from Malaysia and he said he had some money.''<
Carman: ``Ah money. Was it the money that prompted you to drive to London?''<
Grobbelaar: ``No, it was to learn that the Japanese side was no longer
available. He wanted to tell me to my face.''<
Carman: ``Why have a trip contrary to club rules, where you have to lie to a
fellow player to cover your tracks, just to learn that?''<
Grobbelaar: ``He asked me to come and see him and I agreed. I was worried
about my Liverpool career and I wanted to find out about any opportunities.''<
Carman: ``The reality was that you were going to London in the middle of the
night, taking the risk that you might be discovered by the Liverpool management,
because there was to be some discussion between you and the Short Man (Richard
Lim) about the match the following day.''<
Grobbelaar: ``That's simply not true. I will tell you that I have been through
this three times now.''<
Carman: ``You appreciate you are a volunteer in this court. Nobody has made
you come.''<
