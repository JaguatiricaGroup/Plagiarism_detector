          17:00 14/07/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Grobbelaar Nightlead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Carman said that by 1994, Mr Grobbelaar was ``deeply hurt'' by his ``golden
career'' at Liverpool ending with him learning through a newspaper that his
contract was not being renewed.<
Carman: ``The sad reality of your story is that you were tempted by greed to
try and make for yourself a secret iron reserve of money which you could take to
Zimbabwe to forge out a new life.''<
Grobbelaar said that was ``simply untrue'', insisting that he could still have
been playing in the Premier League if his career had not gone ``down the nick''
through the allegations.<
Re-examined by his own counsel, Richard Hartley QC, he said that former
business partner Chris Vincent, who colluded with The Sun over secret
video-tapes on which the newspaper based its story, had wanted to ``destroy me
and my career here''.<
Asked why he would want to do that, Grobbelaar replied: ``Because of the
business dealings in Africa. He wanted to destroy me and really put the knife
in.''<
Mr Vincent, he said, ``had taken the best part of my life away from me.''<
Mr Hartley asked him how it felt to be told by Mr Carman ``time and again''
that he was a liar - and that being reported by both the national and local
press.<
Grobbelaar: ``Well, it hurts me because it hurts my family. I had to make
measures for my children to go out of the country when it first happened. They
were 11 and seven.<
``Now they are 14 and 11. They have lived with us through this whole
tragedy.''<
Mr Hartley asked if he had ``enjoyed'' being cross-examined by Mr Carman.<
Grobbelaar replied: ``Mr Carman does his job to the best of his ability and I
say he's the best.<
``As a footballer I do my job to the best of my ability. On that profile we
are the best and it is unfortunate that I have got to come here to answer
questions to a man who is one of the best.<
``I have not enjoyed it, not 1%.''<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
