  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turning to a taped confrontation between Grobbelaar and two Sun reporters at
Gatwick Airport in November 1994, Mr Carman said that the goalkeeper was given
the opportunity to state his case before publication.<
Carman: ``Why not say this man (Vincent) was corrupt. I was going to report
him to the police and the football authorities - I'm glad you've got it all on
video.''<
Grobbelaar: ``You can well imagine when I got to the airport that I was very
confused with what these people were putting to me and I was like in a state of
shock.''<
Carman: ``Most regrettably I have to suggest to that you were in a state of
shock because you were a guilty man who had been caught out.''<
Grobbelaar: ``Not at all.''<
Carman: ``And that is why you wholly failed to advance the explanation that
you are now advancing on oath to this jury.''<
Grobbelaar: ``Not at all. I was really confused, as anybody would be.''<
Mr Carman said Grobbelaar's denial to the reporters on the tape that he had
taken #2,000 from Vincent a few days before was a ``downright, bare-faced,
wicked and dishonest lie''.<
Grobbelaar has agreed that he took the money from Vincent, as evidence against
him, but says he intended to keep it safe until it could be handed over to the
authorities.<
Visibly angry, the goalkeeper replied: ``And these people weren't being
downright wicked towards me? ... I'm not going to give all the truth on that day
- let them come up with the evidence.<
``I've been found innocent twice and that's why we are here today - because
they have tried to destroy me and my family, the whole of my family.''<
In his eyes, said Grobbelaar, it was not a lie to say he had not taken the
money.<
``It was in my glove compartment for the evidence that I needed,'' he added.<
