               16:14 14/07/99: Page 4 (HHH) COURTS Grobbelaar
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Carman concluded his cross-examination by accusing Mr Grobbelaar of
attempting to pervert the course of justice.<
Carman: ``You had a golden career at Liverpool, did you not?''<
Grobbelaar: ``I did.''<
Carman: ``You were idolised by thousands of fans?''<
Grobbelaar: ``I was, yes.''<
Carman: ``You were a highly successful, talented and gifted goalkeeper?''<
Grobbelaar: ``Yes.''<
Carman: ``A national figure in the sporting world?''<
Grobbelaar: ``I'd say international figure.''<
But, said Mr Carman, by early 1994, the goalkeeper was ``deeply hurt'' by
Liverpool's conduct in not renewing his contract and letting him find out about
it in a newspaper.<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``No, it was not like that. I was not deeply hurt. I knew my
career with Liverpool was going to come to an end someday ... and I had to carry
on with my life.''<
But, said the QC, Mr Grobbelaar, who was earning a basic of #2,400 per week
when he left Liverpool, had slipped in the squad's earnings table from the top
half to the lower half.<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``I never knew where I was in the pecking order and money
actually wasn't the object for me. I never asked for money when I went under
contracts - what they gave me I accepted.''<
He agreed that he was released from his next club, Southampton, on a free
transfer after his contract expired in April 1995.<
``I was still hoping to stay in football but when this all blew up my football
career went down the nick - and I knew I could still be playing in the Premier
League had this allegation not happened.''<
But he played for Oldham Athletic and was, for many years, in charge of his
his national side, which - he said -  knew his calibre and backed him 100%.<
Mr Carman: ``But the sad reality of your story is that you were tempted by
greed to try and make for yourself a secret iron reserve of money which you
could take to Zimbabwe to forge out a new life.''<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``That is simply untrue.''<
Mr Carman said that, when confronted by The Sun in November 1994, Mr
Grobbelaar had lied about whether ``the short man'' existed and carried on with
the lie for eight months in the High Court proceedings.<
When confronted with the newspaper's defence, said Mr Carman, Mr Grobbelaar
had gone on ``formal record'' in the High Court saying that ``the short man''
was a figment of his imagination.<
Mr Grobbelaar: ``I did - yes.''<
And, pressed the QC, he lied about the midnight trip to London to see Mr Lim
and going to north London to see John Fashanu at his home.<
Grobbelaar: ``Yes, and I've given my reason.''<
Carman: ``At that stage in this action, the very action from which you are
claiming damages from this jury, you were lying in an attempt to pervert or
interfere with the course of justice, weren't you?''<
Grobbelaar: ``No.''<
Carman: ``Just as sadly, I have to suggest to you that your whole story is
riddled with lies and evasion and deviousness.''<
Grobbelaar: ``That is simply not true.''<
