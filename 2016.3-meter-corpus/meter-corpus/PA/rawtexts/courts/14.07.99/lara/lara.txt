JUDGE RESCUES LARA FROM BEING `TARNISHED' BY PLAYBOY<
By Mike Taylor, PA News<
A gallant High Court judge tonight rescued Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft from
what she feared would be a fate worse than death - having her name featured on
the cover of Playboy.<
The busty computer-generated Miss Croft was furious at the very idea of
appearing alongside nude pictures of model Nell McAndrew, said by Playboy to be
the real-life incarnation of the character.<
Lara's knight in shining armour appeared in the form of Mr Justice Lloyd, who
granted an injunction requiring Playboy to apply stickers blanking out her name
and the Tomb Raider logo from the cover of 20,000 copies of its August edition.<
The judge had been told by George Hamer, counsel for Tomb Raider trade mark
owners Core Design Ltd, that Lara's ``squeaky-clean image'' would be ``tarnished
for all time'' by any association with soft-core pornography.<
Not so, said Playboy's barrister, Piers Acland. The magazine was a ``top
quality publication'' and was making ``honest use'' of the Lara Croft image in a
way that would promote, rather than damage, the reputation of the Tomb Raider
game.<
Mr Hamer retorted that Playboy had no right to the ``honest use'' defence.<
``There are a great many ladies who are sexy but who would be shocked at the
very idea of appearing in such a magazine,'' he said.<
Playboy's claim that Miss McAndrew was the original model for Lara Croft was
incorrect, Mr Hamer added. She was just the third among a number of models who
had been used since Tomb Raider was launched, he said.<
Core Design, because of practical considerations, did not seek injunctions
blanking out the photo feature on two inside pages and agreed it could do
nothing at present about the 5,000 copies of Playboy already distributed to UK
subscribers or similar material on the magazine's internet website.<
The judge said he was satisfied there was a clearly arguable case for breach
of trade mark in the Lara Croft name and Tomb Raider logo. Playboy had gone
ahead with publication, despite being refused permission by Core Design.<
He made no findings on Core Design's additional allegations of breach of
copyright and ``passing off'', which will be decided at a full hearing of the
case.<
The court order is expected to delay distribution of Playboy's August edition
for about a week while stickers are applied to the cover.<
Playboy was ordered to pay Core's #15,000 costs of the injunction hearing.<
