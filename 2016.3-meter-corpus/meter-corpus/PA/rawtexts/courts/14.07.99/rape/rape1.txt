SEX CHARGE CONSULTANT `NIBBLED PATIENT'S EAR'<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
A consultant gynaecologist nibbled at a patient's ear then told her it was all
part of her treatment, a court heard today.<
Darwish Hasan Darwish, 52, is accused of preying on vulnerable women then
sexually assaulting them after hypnotising them into a zombie-like state.<
The prosecution at Manchester Crown Court alleges that Darwish, who faces one
charge of rape and 11 of indecent assault on ten different women, abused them
after they came to him for help. <
One witness told the court today that over a series of visits in 1981, she
gained comfort through talking to him about her problems.<
She told the court that on one occasion he hypnotised her then ran the palms
of his hands over her breasts.<
She said: ``I jumped up in the chair but was embarrassed to say anything. I
wasn't sure if it was an accident - I wanted it to be.''<
On the next occasion she arrived at the clinic at St Catherine's Hospital,
Wirral, Merseyside, and underwent the usual relaxation process.<
She said: ``Dr Darwish was going through what he usually did - talking about
being in a park with birds singing.<
``Then he walked around the front of me, he took my hand and stood me up. He
then sat down and he sat me on his knee.<
``He had his arms closed around my waist and started to pinch at my ear with
his mouth.<
``I couldn't get my thoughts together and think what was going on. I was very
disorientated. I couldn't move and felt stuck, I didn't know why I couldn't
move. He was nibbling at my ear.<
``I managed to get my thoughts together and said `What are you doing'.<
``He said it was part of the treatment.''<
The witness went on to tell the court that when she left the hospital she felt
disorientated and tired. The traffic outside seemed to be moving at 100mph and
she had difficulty remembering where the bus stop was.<
She told her husband and GP about what had happened and then received a phone
call from Darwish asking her to see him so that she could be discharged.<
She said: ``He was angry. He said that I was mad because of the accusations I
had made against him.<
``He said that I was fantasising  and that it was all in the mind.''<
During cross examination Kieran Coonan QC, representing Darwish of Kings
Drive, Caldy, Wirral, suggested that the witness had made the incident up and
was affected by the fact that she was abused as a child by her father.<
