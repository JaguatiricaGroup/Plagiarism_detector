LOVERS JAILED FOR SPURNED HUSBAND'S SHOTGUN MURDER<
By Adam Jankiewicz, PA News<
A businessman who executed his lover's husband with her full knowledge by
shooting him in the back with a 12 bore shotgun was jailed for life today.<
Adrian Littlebury, 54, admitted murdering surveyor David Tomkins in the quiet
Buckinghamshire village of Lacey Green in October last year and was jailed for
life.<
His lover, 49-year-old Penelope Tomkins, admitted soliciting her husband's
murder when they appeared together at Reading Crown Court.<
She was jailed for three years and six months.<
In a letter written to her lover after the murder she wrote: ``I am as guilty
as you are, my love for you goes beyond this life. God forgive us both.''<
Passing sentence Mr Justice Blofeld said: ``It remains a complete mystery why
the two of you, a mature man and a mature woman, both of positively good
character, should have allowed yourselves to get involved in this matter.''<
The court was told that Littlebury, who had become infatuated during his two
year relationship, had waited for his victim to return from work before firing
the shotgun into 51-year-old Mr Tomkins as he stepped out of his Mazda MX5
convertible to enter the family home on October 27 last year.<
The shotgun was bought just three days before the killing and the court heard
that Littlebury had enrolled on clay pigeon shooting classes in the months
before the murder to learn how to use the weapon.<
Minutes after the shooting Mrs Tomkins arrived back at the house to find her
husband fatally wounded lying in the street.<
The court was told she cradled him in her arms saying: ``I love you, I love
you.''<
The day after the murder the couple, who had been married for 28 years and had
two children, were due to complete the purchase of a new home.<
Michael Lawson QC, prosecuting, said the lovers started their relationship
when they both worked at Ultra Electronics in High Wycombe, Bucks, and ``clearly
the domestic situation interrupted the affection they had for one another''.<
He said: ``In the summer and autumn of 1997 the bonds of their difficulties
brought them closer together until the relationship became intimate. This
continued until the date of the killing.''<
Littlebury, of Fairholm Crescent, Hayes, Middlesex, who was single, was said
to have become increasingly obsessed with his lover during their relationship
and described them ``as two halves of a whole''.<
In February of 1998, the court was told, Mrs Tomkins left her husband, but
returned to the family home four months later. ``Not out of love for her
husband, but to recreate the family unit in an attempt not to lose the love of
her children,'' said Mr Lawson.<
Following the brutal murder, Littlebury handed himself over to police and
admitted to the killing telling detectives: ``I knew deep down our relationship
would never end. I knew wherever she was, she would come back to me.''<
In police interviews Mrs Tomkins confessed to her role telling detectives: ``I
gave Adrian information and he actively gave me information about what he
intended to do.<
``I did nothing to stop him. I wanted to be free.<
``I didn't love David as a man any more. I didn't have the strength of
character or guts to walk away. I saw in David's death as the only way I would
ever be free.''<
She said she had confessed as her conscience was eating her away so she could
hardly breathe.<
Silver-haired Littlebury and petite brunette Tomkins remained impassive as
sentencing was passed.<
Mr Justice Blofeld told Littlebury: ``The only sentence I am empowered to pass
on you is that of a life sentence and I do that.''<
