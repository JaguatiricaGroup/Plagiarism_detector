MURDER BID BRITON DROPS RETRIAL CLAIM<
By Cahal Milmo, PA News<
A Briton who admitted soaking his former girlfriend in petrol and setting her
on her fire withdrew an attempt today to overturn his guilty plea.<
Stephen Rae, 33, from Crieff, Perthshire, had asked for a retrial on a charge
of attempted murder against nurse Gabriella Mazzali after claiming he was
coerced into admitting the attack at her home in Sydney, Australia.<
The former teacher pleaded guilty at a court hearing in October to the attack
in February 1998 which left Ms Mazzali, 29, from Lincolnshire, with horrific
burns to virtually her entire body.<
Doctors gave the British woman virtually no chance of surviving her injuries
after discovering the only part of her body to have escaped the burns were the
soles of her feet.<
But after a series of major skin graft operations, the nurse made a miraculous
recovery, returning to Britain before then travelling back to Sydney to give
evidence at her former boyfriend's trial.<
The court heard how Rae broke down the door to Ms Mazzali's flat in Sydney and
set her on fire after she broke off their relationship. She had been living in
Australia for two years.<
Speaking after his guilty plea at the time, Ms Mazzali said: ``I am absolutely
elated by the fact that he had decided to plead guilty because it indicates that
he is now accepting responsibility for what he has done.<
``It means I can get on with the rest of my life.''<
Rae, who faces up to 25 years in prison, put forward a motion this week asking
for a new trial but later withdrew it ahead of legal submissions to be made by
lawyers on his behalf later today.<
A Parramatta District Court spokesman said: ``The motion has been withdrawn
and a further hearing will take place on legal matters.''<
The Briton is expected to be sentenced at a later date.<
