BEHAVIOUR ORDER FOR SCHOOLBOY WITH 55 CONVICTIONS<
By Damien Brook, PA News<
A 14-year-old boy convicted 55 times in the last two years was made the
subject of an Anti-Social Behaviour Order today.<
The boy now faces the prospect of appearing in court for offences which are
not even criminal.<
Nottingham City Council applied for the order because it said the courts had
failed to protect the community from the boy, who cannot be named for legal
reasons.<
Today stipendiary magistrate Peter Nuttall told the 4ft 8in teenager the
behaviour order meant he was not allowed to trespass on any commercial or
residential property within 1,200 metres of his home in the Bulwell area of
Nottingham.<
He is also not to use abusive or threatening language or behaviour to anyone
within the same radius.<
Mr Nuttall added that a third part of the order, not to take or drive or ride
any mechanised vehicle, would apply to the whole of the Nottingham City Council
area.<
The order has been imposed for two years and means the boy can be brought back
to court and sentenced for committing even non-criminal offences if he breaches
the terms of the order.<
Following today's decision the Deputy Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire,
Robin Searle, said: ``I am delighted the courts have seen fit to support this
application.<
``This important ruling shows that those young people whose behaviour is so
anti-social and abusive but falls short of being criminal, can be dealt with
quickly.''<
He added: ``This is a powerful message to communities who in the past felt we
could or would not do anything.''<
Councillor Colin Chapman, leader of the city council, said: ``It is wonderful
that the magistrates have backed us.<
``People are fed up with children like these getting away time and time
again.''<
Mr Chapman said three more similar cases were being prepared by the council's
Anti-Social Behaviour Team.<
During the two-day application by the council the court was read a list of the
boy's past convictions.<
Inspector Jeff Whitmore of Notts police said the teenager had been arrested
and convicted on charges including theft, taking vehicles without consent,
robbery, burglary, handling stolen goods and motoring offences.<
There were also convictions for aggravated and racial harassment.<
He added that the defendant had also been convicted of spitting at a traffic
warden and stamping on a police officer's foot.<
Today the boy went into the witness box to give evidence.<
He said all the witnesses who claimed to have seen him offending or committing
anti-social acts were either lying or had mistaken him for someone else.<
When asked by his barrister Phillipa Kaufmann if he had ever stolen, been
abusive or threatened anyone he said No.<
He told the court: ``I have been arrested for things I have done and for
things I haven't done.<
``I have been keeping out of trouble.''<
Imposing the two-year order magistrate Mr Nuttall took the boy to one side of
the court and carefully explained the terms of the order. He made no comment and
left the court with his father Robert.<
