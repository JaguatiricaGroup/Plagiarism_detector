FAYED BIGGEST CROOK IN TOWN, SAYS EX-SECURITY CHIEF<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Mohamed Al Fayed is ``the biggest crook in town'', his former head of security
told the High Court today.<
Brian Dodd, a one-time SAS man and retired professional bodyguard, told Mr
Justice Morland and the jury in the ``cash for questions'' libel action that he
had been ``tainted'' with the same brush as former Tatton MP Neil Hamilton.<
Mr Dodd, 62, a holder of the Military Medal, worked for Mr Al Fayed from March
1984 until August 1986 when, according to the Harrods boss, he was sacked for
gross misconduct.<
That was angrily denied today in a high-volume performance, which ended with
the judge ordering Mr Dodd to leave the witness box and then abruptly rising
from the bench.<
As the jury was swiftly ushered out of Court 13, a defiant Mr Dodd shouted
out: ``I apologise Mr Hamilton _ I do not think I have done your case any
good.''<
Just a few minutes earlier, Mr Dodd had told the court that he had sat on his
bed last night and watched Mrs Hamilton's wife, Christine, on the news.<
``God knows how I felt ... I am tainted with the same brush as Neil
Hamilton.''<
Adding that he was not sacked but that the system was changed, he went on: ``I
have got to leave this court a tainted man by Mr Fayed, who's the biggest bloody
crook in this town.''<
Mr Hamilton is suing Mr Al Fayed over allegations on a January 1997 Channel 4
Dispatches programme that he had corruptly demanded and accepted cash payments,
gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking
parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods.<
Mr Al Fayed, who was not in court today, denies libel and pleads
justification.<
Mr Dodd said that while he worked for Mr Al Fayed, he ``would have gone to
hell and back'' for him and would have done anything he was asked.<
He was in charge of security at Mr Al Fayed's Park Lane offices and
apartments, where the staff included doorman Philip Bromfield, who has alleged
that he handed two envelopes over to Mr Hamilton.<
Mr Dodd said that he made Mr Bromfield and others keep a book in which to
enter the names and times when envelopes of cash were collected, so as to
``cover themselves''.<
``There were up to 15 a week to people he (Al Fayed) was paying off.''<
There was also a book for anyone who went to see Mr Al Fayed _ ``Labour MPs,
Tory MPs and a whole load of Lords''.<
Mr Dodd said that when Mr Al Fayed's brother, Ali, found out about the book,
it was taken upstairs and ``they went mad about it''.<
``I said that I needed to know who is in the building in case there is a
fire,'' Mr Dodd told the court.<
``I said you can call them Donald Duck One and Donald Duck Two, but I will
have the names in my book or I will not do my job.''<
An agreement was reached that the names of anyone who went upstairs would go
in the book, and in the evening the book itself would go up.<
