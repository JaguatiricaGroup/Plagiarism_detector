Mr Dodd said he would accompany Mr Al Fayed when he walked around the shop floor
of Harrods, two or three times a week.<
It was a nightmare for a bodyguard because Mr Al Fayed would often bump into
people and engage them in conversation, frequently inviting them to go to the
Ritz if they were in Paris, he said.<
To protests from Mr George Carman QC, for Mr Al Fayed, he went on: ``I can
understand Mr Hamilton's problem _ one of the rooms in 1986 cost #3,000 a night
without breakfast ... the average person could not afford to stay there ...<
``If they said they couldn't afford to stay there ...<
Mr Carman: ``My Lord, will you stop this witness please ...<
Mr Dodd carried on: ``So he would say `you must come as my guest'...''<
Cross-examined by Mr Carman, Mr Dodd repeatedly shouted over counsel and
refused to answer his questions ``yes'' or ``no'' unless he could add lengthy
explanations.<
Mr Carman produced a letter which Mr Dodd wrote to Mr Al Fayed in January
1995, asking if he had any work available as there was very little in Clwyd,
North Wales, where he lived.<
It read: ``I would find no difficulty in giving you and your family my
complete loyalty as I always have in the past'', and added that he still admired
Mr Al Fayed and missed the ``good years'' working for him.<
Asked why he had written in such terms, Mr Dodd said: ``It may have been a bit
of pomp, a bit of bullshit _ maybe I miss the security.''<
Mr Dodd said that Mr Al Fayed's secretaries, Alison Bozek and Iris Bond _ both
of whom have given evidence that they saw their boss put cash in envelopes for
Mr Hamilton _ shredded pages from the book Mr Dodd had kept.<
``It's my knowledge, because each day the page was ripped out, it was not
allowed to be seen,'' he said.<
``In 1986, I burned 40 sacks of documents from Mr Fayed's office that he
wanted to hide _ 40 _ it took me four hours, on a bonfire.''<
He had not mentioned to anyone about shredding documents before today because
``it was unimportant, petty'', he said.<
