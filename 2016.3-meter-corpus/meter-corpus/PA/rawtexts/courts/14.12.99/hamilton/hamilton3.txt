   Mr Dodd, who admitted under questioning to three speeding tickets and
having been involved with the police over a domestic incident with his brother,
heatedly denied that he was guilty of ``criminal'' behaviour while working for
Mr Al Fayed.<
Mr Al Fayed had told him to throw one of the Park Lane tenants ``on an effing
skip'', he said.<
``He said `you kill him, you do what you effing like with him, get him out of
that flat'.<
``He gave me the keys to go in and do it,'' Mr Dodd said.<
He agreed that he and another man went into the flat, found four suitcases
which they filled with documents and later burned, and had left a note on a
cornflakes box saying ``We have missed you this time. We won't miss you next
time.''<
Mr Dodd told the court: ``I was doing no criminal damage whatsoever. It was
not criminal. It was Mr Fayed's apartment, on his instructions that I went in
there.<
``It was a damn sight lesser than what he wanted me to do to him.''<
Asked if the message on the cereal packet was a threat to the tenant, Mr Dodd
said: ``Correct.''<
The man was not a lawful tenant as he had not paid rent for six years, Mr Dodd
said.<
He agreed that he lied to police investigating the break-in, saying he was
``terribly loyal'' to his employer.<
He added: ``Don't make me out to be a criminal until I've been proved criminal
in a court of law.''<
Mr Dodd agreed that he had made ``fictitious'' entries in a book about the
comings and goings at Park Lane.<
On one occasion he falsely noted that two American girls, who stayed in a flat
there, ``used to bring home five or six men at night as if they were running a
brothel''.<
He said they did take men back but the entry was false because he was not in
the room with them and did not know if they were prostitutes.<
Re-examined by Mr Desmond Browne QC, for Hamilton, Mr Dodd agreed with a
statement he had given to the effect that ``at Mr Fayed's bidding'' he had
engaged in ``dirty tricks`` to carry out his employer's wishes.<
He had once ordered his number two to go into the office in Park Lane of Mr Al
Fayed's brother-in-law, Adnan Khashoggi, he said.<
In late 1984, he added, Mr Al Fayed had asked him to get rid of a resident so
that an apartment owned by his son Dodi could be extended.<
Mr Dodd said that Mr Al Fayed told him: ``Get that bastard out of here _ throw
him in a f---ing skip if need be. I want him out.''<
Mr Dodd: ``I told him there were other ways of going about it, and he said go
about it in any way I like.''<
As the evidence in the case concluded, the jury was sent away until Thursday,
when both counsel will make their closing speeches.<
The jury will retire to consider its verdict on Monday morning.<
