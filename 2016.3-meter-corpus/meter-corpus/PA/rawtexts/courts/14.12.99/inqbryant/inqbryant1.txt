RIDDLE OF MURDER VICTIM'S MISSING 45 MINUTES<
By Nick Allen, PA News<
A coroner today recorded a verdict of unlawful killing on grandmother Linda
Bryant who was found dead near her village home.<
Cornwall coroner Edward Carlyon told an inquest in Truro: ``I am in no doubt
at all that this person was assaulted and stabbed and died as a result of the
assault and stabbing.''<
The body of Mrs Bryant, 41, was found in the gateway to a field near her home
at Ruan High Lanes near Truro on October 20, 1998.<
Police conducting a murder inquiry, now over a year old, have talked to more
than 18,000 people and taken 7,000 statements but still have no murder weapon
and no DNA sample from the killer.<
At the inquest a statement was read from Julia Stevenson, who was on holiday
nearby and found the body as she drove by in her grey Porsche 911 Carrera.<
She said she came across the body when she saw Mrs Bryant's dog and slowed
down because she thought it might jump out in front of her car.<
She was ``very shaken'' but realised she had to call an ambulance.<
She rushed back to Treviles Manor where she had been renting a barn conversion
and raised the alarm.<
She was met in the driveway by Marlene Goodland who owned the nearby fields.<
``I could hear a car horn frantically blowing and I could hear the car was
coming into the driveway,'' said Ms Goodland.<
``She looked a bit panicky and shocked and said ring for an ambulance.''<
Both Ms Goodland and farm labourer Richard Kneebone, who went to the scene,
knew Mrs Bryant.<
Ms Goodland said she could see a three-inch cut on Mrs Bryant's neck.<
She said it was ``odd'' that the lurcher was found without a lead on.<
She also said: ``For some reason it seemed to me she had been laid where she
was, there was no struggle, and that that had happened somewhere else.''<
Detective Superintendent Chris Boarland, the senior officer investigating the
murder, told the inquest: ``The most obvious wounds were those to the neck but
the fatal wounds were stab wounds to the abdomen which became clear at the post
mortem examination.''<
A statement was also read from laundry assistant Irene Harris who saw Mrs
Bryant in her car at a petrol station at between 1.10pm and 1.15pm on the day of
her death and had congratulated her on becoming a grandmother.<
She said when Mrs Bryant drove off a white van driven by a man with a bushy
beard headed off in the same direction.<
In a statement retired Reginald Buckingham, who was driving in the area, said
he passed a man and a woman in the road with a lurcher at around 1.45pm.<
After the inquest Mr Boarland said: ``We are looking at a total period of
between 1.45pm and just after 2.30pm when her body was found.<
``There is a three-quarters of an hour window when this offence was
committed.''<
Although Ms Goodland and Ms Stevenson described their impression that the body
may have been moved, he said: ``We are quite clear it happened where her body
was found. It was just the position her body was lying in that gave people that
thought.''<
He said police were still keen to talk to the man in the white van.<
