STUDENT FELL TO DEATH AFTER CLIFFTOP PHOTO<
By James Morrison, PA News<
A German student on a school trip to England plunged from a coastal beauty
spot seconds after having her photograph taken by a teacher, an inquest heard
today.<
Ramona Affeldt, 17, tried in vain to grab on to the cliff edge after slipping
while sightseeing at Beachy Head, East Sussex, with her schoolmates from
Hamburg.<
Recording a verdict of accidental death, Eastbourne coroner Alan Craze said
Beachy Head was a major tourist attraction but was extremely dangerous.<
``Sadly, this young German student who was visiting this country was near the
edge and, in a completely accidental way, managed to lose her footing having
been photographed, and managed then to slip over the edge.''<
