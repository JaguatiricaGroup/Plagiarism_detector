  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The inquest heard that 56 schoolchildren were taken to Beachy Head by coach
three days before the end of a week-long trip to Sussex on September 21.<
In a written statement read to the court, fellow pupil Simon Newdeck said he
had been standing near the edge of the cliff with Ramona while their teacher,
Karin Holst, took a picture with her camera.<
He said: ``Mrs Holst took a photograph of us and I walked away.<
``I had my back to Ramona, who made a sudden, surprised, noise.''<
Another pupil, Yildiz Gumus, said: ``Ramona looked like she was trying to grab
something on the cliff edge, but this was only for a moment before she fell from
view.''<
Oliver Arndt, who also goes to the school, said: ``We were looking at the
scenery because it was so beautiful.<
``Myself and a friend were standing near the edge, and I saw a sign saying,
`Mind the edge'.<
``A friend of ours, Ramona, seemed to be standing very close to the edge. She
turned around to have her picture taken, and then lost her footing.''<
In her own statement, Mrs Holst, a teacher for 32 years, described how she
walked with a party of her students to an area near the cliff edge.<
As she stood about a metre from the edge and 10 metres from Ramona, she
decided to take a picture of some of the students.<
She said: ``I called out to Ramona. Ramona disappeared behind one of the
boys.<
``I then called her name again, and ran up to Ramona. I could see Ramona over
the edge, and she was rolling down.''<
A pupil from another school, Denit Ergec, said: ``I saw her on a muddy shelf
about a foot above the cliff edge.''<
When he looked back a moment later, after her fall, her feet were pointing
towards the beach and her head was just beneath the cliff edge, which she was
attempting to cling onto.<
He added: ``She said nothing, and within a second, as I walked towards her,
she let go.''<
Social worker Gisele Fehrs, who had been filming the view around the Belle
Tout Lighthouse with a camcorder, said: ``When I looked up again I saw someone
falling over the edge of the cliff. I did not know it was Ramona who had fallen
at this time.<
``I was very shocked. I tried to call out to someone that someone had fallen
but I don't think anything came out.''<
Coach driver Bernard Noschra added that he had warned the party about the
dangers of the cliff edge before they alighted from the coach that morning.<
