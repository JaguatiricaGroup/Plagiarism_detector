DJ's DESCENT INTO HELLISH WORLD OF CHILD PORN<
By Jo Butler, Home Affairs Correspondent, PA News<
To millions of radio listeners, Chris Denning was known as one of the DJs who
helped give birth to Radio One.<
To the police, he was known as a child abuser and pornographer for years
before he ended up on child molesting charges in the Czech Republic.<
Denning, one of the original line-up of DJs on the BBC's Radio One when it
launched in 1967, told the Prague court he had been gay for as long as he could
remember and as he became adult, his taste turned to 16- and 17-year-old
youths.<
He also told the court he had been an occasional child prostitute between the
ages of 14 and 18.<
The on-air slip-up which prompted his departure from Radio One was an ominous
warning of more trouble to come.<
He joked to listeners: ``I got up this morning feeling like a 16-year-old, but
where do you get one of those at 6am?''<
After his radio career came to an end, Denning moved into voice-overs and
proved relatively successful.<
At the same time he continued in the music and video business, and was for a
time chief executive of a record company, UK Records.<
But police say his main trade was producing and supplying pornographic
material, using both adult and child subjects, from his home in Bracknell,
Berks.<
Despite spending about #10,000 seeing a psychoanalyst on a daily basis during
the 1970s, Denning's inappropriate sexual leanings eventually landed him with a
string of convictions.<
His first conviction came at the Old Bailey in 1974 when he was fined and put
on probation for publishing obscene material and gross indecency with a boy aged
11.<
In 1985, he was jailed for 18 months at Bournemouth Crown Court for publishing
obscene material and gross indecency with a child under 13.<
Just three years later received a three year sentence, at Northampton Crown
Court, for gross indecency with a 13-year-old boy, incitement to commit
indecency and taking obscene photographs.<
Then in January 1996, he was jailed for 10 weeks for possessing child
pornography.<
After that, he began travelling to Eastern Europe, an area which has become a
honeypot for paedophiles, having the fatal combination of desperate poverty and
loose social controls which make it easy to pick up, or even buy, children.<
Police at the National Criminal Intelligence Service in London, who track
paedophile behaviour in the UK and worked with Czech units to bring Denning to
justice, warned that the crackdown on sex tourism in the Far East has added to
Eastern Europe's attractions.<
Bryan Drew, head of the Strategic and Specialist Intelligence Branch, said the
problem was made worse by law enforcers susceptible to corruption and less
awareness of the dangers of HIV/Aids.<
In Prague, Denning lured boys back to his flat with promises of money and
gifts. <
Boys were also offered cash to take part in pornographic activities which
Denning filmed, transmitting the images back to his Bracknell home for copying.<
He also had the equipment to post live images on to the Internet, although
police say there is no evidence that he was doing this.<
The tapes he made were then sold on to a German wholesale company at about
#1,600 a time for distribution across a potentially international network.<
All the boys featured in the videos and photographs had to fill in consent
forms, signing away the rights to the images as well as stating that they were
over 18.<
But police say it was obvious that some of the children were much younger than
this, and claim some were as young as 10-years-old.<
Police in the UK tipped off their Czech counterparts in early 1997 when
Denning came back to their attention.<
Denning was singled out by the prosecution as the ringleader of a gang,
distributing paedophile videos across the world.<
It is not thought that he used any British children for his perverse business
and would not currently face prosecution in this country if he were to return
here.<
Denning claimed that the period between June and November 1997, when he was
arrested by Czech police, was ``the happiest time of my life''.<
As he prepared to spend the next phase of his life in a Czech jail, Denning
will have plenty of time to reminisce.<
