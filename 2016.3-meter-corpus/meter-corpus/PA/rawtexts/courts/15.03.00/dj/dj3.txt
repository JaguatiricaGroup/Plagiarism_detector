Norman Trew, head of the NCIS paedophile intelligence unit, said: ``Paedophiles
of the extremely serious type, like Denning, believe that they can travel to
destinations outside the UK's jurisdiction where they often feel they are safe
from the law.<
``Today this has clearly been indicated not to be the case. Paedophiles are
manipulative and cunning and will look for any opportunity to gain close contact
with children.''<
Commenting on the operation with the Czech authorities, he said:
``International cooperation is key to ensuring the safety of children throughout
the world and the case against Christopher Denning is a brilliant example of
this.''<
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``Sex abuse of children is an unforgivable
crime.<
``The British Government deplores child abuse of any kind and I am determined
to protect the rights of the child wherever they are violated.''<
