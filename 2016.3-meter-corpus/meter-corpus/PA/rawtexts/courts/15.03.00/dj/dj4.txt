Denning is thought to have trawled gypsy sites outside Prague and bribed parents
with drugs to get their children.<
He then took them back to his room where he abused them. Denning had admitted
having sex with underage boys but said he believed they were all over the age of
consent.<
He said he gave the boys money to pay for drinks and play video games but not
for sex.<
``Because I believed it was all legal, I made no attempt to be discreet or
secretive,'' he told the court.<
Denning has previous convictions in Britain for sex assaults on boys but
claimed that he vowed in 1987 to give up illegal sexual activity.<
But he later travelled to Eastern Europe, which has become increasingly
popular among paedophiles because of the crackdown on sex-tourists in the Far
East.<
Poverty meant that the youngsters were prepared to do what he asked and he
sold on the tapes for about #1,600 a time for distribution.<
He was tried in Prague along with three other foreign nationals. Two of them
were convicted, with one jailed for three-and-a-half years and the other for
three years, according to the Foreign Office.<
A spokesman said they have eight days in which to lodge an appeal.<
