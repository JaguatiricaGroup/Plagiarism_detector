QC BRANDS IRVING A RABID ANTI-SEMITE<
By Cathy Gordon and Jan Colley, PA News<
Historian David Irving is a ``rabid anti-Semite'' who has falsified history on
a staggering scale in pursuit of his obsessive desire to exonerate Hitler of
responsibility for the Nazi persecution of the Jews, the High Court was told
today.<
The accusations were made by Richard Rampton QC, who is representing American
academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books in the libel action brought against
them by Mr Irving, the 62-year-old author of Hitler's War, over claims that he
is a ``Holocaust denier''.<
There was standing room only in the modern courtroom at London's Law Courts as
Mr Rampton made his closing submissions to Mr Justice Gray, who has heard the
lengthy and complex case without a jury.<
Mr Irving, of Duke Street, Mayfair, central London, who is representing
himself, was due to deliver his own closing speech after Mr Rampton.<
The judge is expected to reserve his judgment after the speeches are
completed.<
Mr Irving is seeking damages over Professor Lipstadt's 1994 book, Denying the
Holocaust, which he says has generated waves of hatred against him.<
The defendants deny libel.<
Mr Rampton accused Mr Irving of being a ``liar'' whose Holocaust denial had
been ``exposed as a fraud'', and said he had falsified history on a massive
scale.<
``By the defendants' estimate, there are, in relation to Hitler alone, as many
as 25 major falsifications of history, as well as numerous subsidiary
inventions, suppressions, manipulations and mistranslations employed to support
the major falsifications,'' Mr Rampton said.<
``If those relating to Auschwitz, Dresden and other matters are added in, the
number goes well over 30.''<
Mr Rampton said: ``As the evidence in this court has shown, Mr Irving is a
right-wing extremist, a racist and, in particular, a rabid anti-Semite.<
``How far, if at all, Mr Irving's anti-Semitism is a cause of his Hitler
apology, or vice-versa, is unimportant.<
``Whether they are taken together, or individually, it is clear that they have
led him to prostitute his reputation as a serious historian _ spurious though it
can now be seen to have been _ for the sake of a bogus rehabilitation of Hitler
and the dissemination of virulent anti-Semitic propaganda.''<
