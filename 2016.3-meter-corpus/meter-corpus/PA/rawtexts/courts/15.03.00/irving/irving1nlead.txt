LIBEL CLAIM AUTHOR ATTACKS `30 YEARS OF VILIFICATION'<
By Cathy Gordon and Jan Colley, PA News<
Hitler's War author David Irving today told the High Court he has been the
victim of a ``30-year international endeavour'' by a group of organisations to
destroy his legitimacy as a historian.<
Mr Irving, who is suing American academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books
for libel over claims that he is a ``Holocaust denier'', said: ``I have been
subjected since at least 1973 and probably before then to what would be called
in warfare a campaign of interdiction.<
``I know of no other historian or writer who has been subjected to a campaign
of vilification even one-tenth as intense.''<
He said Professor Lipstadt's 1994 book, Denying the Holocaust, which is at the
centre of the case, was the ``climax'' of the campaign.<
Mr Irving, 62, of Duke Street, Mayfair, central London, who is representing
himself in his damages action, made his comments during his 104-page closing
speech to Mr Justice Gray, who has heard the lengthy and complex case without a
jury at London's Law Courts.<
The case was not about the reputation of the Holocaust but about his
reputation ``as a human being, as an historian of integrity'', Mr Irving told
the packed courtroom.<
``A judgment in my favour is no more than a judgment that disputed points
which I have made about some aspects of the narrative are not so absurd, given
the evidence, as to disqualify me from the ranks of historians.''<
A judgment against him would mean that no-one would dare to discuss who
exactly was involved in each stage of the Holocaust or how extensive it was.<
``A judgment in my favour does not mean that the Holocaust never happened; it
means only that in England today discussion is still permitted.''<
Mr Irving said that as a result of his work, the Holocaust had been researched
more and was the subject of ``a live and on-going discussion''.<
Dismissing Professor Lipstadt's book as ``malicious and deeply flawed'', Mr
Irving said the defendants had made _ and not justified in court _ one of the
``gravest libels'' that could be imagined for a respectable English citizen.<
The defendants had accused him of being a Holocaust denier who has falsified
history to exonerate Hitler.<
Mr Irving said: ``I submit that I have not distorted, manipulated, and
falsified. I have put all the cards on the table; I made the documents available
to all comers, on microfilm and in the archives, and I have pointed to various
possible interpretations.''<
He told the judge: ``For the defendants to describe me as one who manipulates,
distorts and falsifies it would be necessary for them to satisfy your lordship
that I wilfully adopted perverse and ridiculous interpretations. I have not.''<
Mr Irving said: ``Mistakes undoubtedly occur: the mistranscription of
difficult German words pencilled in Gothic or Sutterlin-style script, a script
which most modern German scholars find unreadable anyway; mistakes of copying;
mistakes of omission ... These are innocent mistakes and with a book the size of
Hitler's War, currently running to 393,000 words, they are not surprising.''<
He added: ``The allegation that the mistakes are deliberate _ that they are
manipulations or distortions _ is a foul one to make and easily disposed of by
general considerations.''<
Richard Rampton QC, counsel for Professor Lipstadt and Penguin Books, when
making his final submissions to the judge, accused Mr Irving of being a ``rabid
anti-Semite'' who had falsified history on a staggering scale in pursuit of his
obsessive desire to exonerate Hitler of responsibility for the Nazi persecution
of the Jews.<
Counsel, who accused Mr Irving of being a ``liar'' whose Holocaust denial had
been ``exposed as a fraud'', said he had falsified history on a massive scale.<
``By the defendants' estimate, there are, in relation to Hitler alone, as many
as 25 major falsifications of history, as well as numerous subsidiary
inventions, suppressions, manipulations and mistranslations employed to support
the major falsifications,'' Mr Rampton said.<
``If those relating to Auschwitz, Dresden and other matters are added in, the
number goes well over 30.''<
Mr Rampton said: ``As the evidence in this court has shown, Mr Irving is a
right-wing extremist, a racist and, in particular, a rabid anti-Semite.<
``How far, if at all, Mr Irving's anti-Semitism is a cause of his Hitler
apology, or vice-versa, is unimportant.<
``Whether they are taken together, or individually, it is clear that they have
led him to prostitute his reputation as a serious historian _ spurious though it
can now be seen to have been _ for the sake of a bogus rehabilitation of Hitler
and the dissemination of virulent anti-Semitic propaganda.''<
But Mr Irving strongly denounced the claims as ``evil allegations and slurs
which lend fire and fury to the original libel''.<
Reserving his decision, the judge said he would give his judgment in ``a small
number of weeks''.<
