  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Irving opened his 104-page closing speech by saying that the case was not
about the reputation of the Holocaust but about his reputation ``as a human
being, as an historian of integrity''.<
``A judgment in my favour is no more than a judgment that disputed points
which I have made about some aspects of the narrative are not so absurd, given
the evidence, as to disqualify me from the ranks of historians.''<
A judgment against him would mean that no-one would dare to discuss who
exactly was involved in each stage of the Holocaust or how extensive it was.<
``A judgment in my favour does not mean that the Holocaust never happened; it
means only that in England today discussion is still permitted.''<
Mr Irving said that as a result of his work, the Holocaust had been researched
more and was the subject of ``a live and on-going discussion''.<
Dismissing Prof Lipstadt's book as ``malicious and deeply flawed'', Mr Irving
said that the defendants had made - and not justified in court - one of the
``gravest libels'' that could be imagined for a respectable English citizen.<
This was that he consorted with the ``extremist anti-Semitic Russian group
Pamyat, with violent anti-Israeli murderers, with extremist terrorists, and with
Louis Farrakhan, a Black Power agitator who is known to be acting in the pay of
a foreign power, namely the Libyan dictator''.<
They had also offered no justification for repeating the ``lie'' that he had a
portrait of Hitler over his desk - the only signed photograph in his flat was
one of Winston Churchill.<
Mr Irving said that in assessing the defence claim that he was a historian who
``distorts, manipulates and falsifies'', the judge should give most weight to
his ``avowedly historical written works'' and regard his speeches ``and the very
occasional lapses of taste in them'' as background material.<
He had always insisted on using original documents and in making copies of
them freely available to others.<
``If, therefore, some of my interpretations are controversial, I also do all
that is possible to let other people judge for themselves.<
``This speaks strongly against the accusation that I distort, manipulate and
falsify history.''<
What he actually wrote in his ``flagship study'', Hitler's War, was that
Hitler was clearly responsible for the Holocaust both by being head of state,
and by having done so much by his speeches and organisation to start it off.<
``Where I differed from many historians was in denying that there was any
documentary proof of detailed direction and initiation of the mass murders by
Hitler.<
``The view was considered to be heretical at the time. But this lack of
wartime documentary evidence for Hitler's involvement is now widely accepted.''<
He added: ``In Hitler's War, I differed from other historians in suggesting
that the actual mass murders were not all or mainly initiated by Hitler.<
``I pointed out that my sources were consistent with another explanation: a
conscious desire `not to know'...<
``I submit that I have not distorted, manipulated, and falsified. I have put
all the cards on the table; I made the documents available to allcomers, on
microfilm and in the archives, and I have pointed to various possible
interpretations.''<
He said that while certainly ``selling'' his view, he was much less
manipulative than those historians who argued that he ought not to be heard
because his views were ``too outlandish or extreme''.<
``Disgracefully, these scholars have cheered from the sidelines as I have been
outlawed, arrested, harassed, and all but vernichtet (annihilated) as a
professional historian; and they have put pressure on British publishers to
destroy my works.''<
