  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Irving said his words were ``often accepted, quoted and echoed by other
historians far more eminent than I''.<
Some may regard his interpretations as not the most probable, he said, ``but
they are never perverse''.<
He told the judge: ``For the defendants to describe me as one who manipulates,
distorts and falsifies it would be necessary for them to satisfy your lordship
that I wilfully adopted perverse and ridiculous interpretations. I have not.''<
Mr Irving said: ``The task facing a historian of my type _ what I refer to as
a `shirtsleeve historian' working in the field from original records _ is very
different from the task facing the scholar or academic who sits in his
book-lined study, plucking handy works of reference, printed in large type,
translated into English, provided with easy indices and often with nice
illustrations too, off the shelves of a university library within arm's
reach.''<
He added that while researching the Goebbels diaries in Moscow in 1992: ``I
had to read those wartime Nazi glass microfiches through a magnifier the size of
a nailclipper with a lens smaller than a pea.''<
Mr Irving said: ``Mistakes undoubtedly occur: the mistranscription of
difficult German words pencilled in Gothic or Sutterlin-style script, a script
which most modern German scholars find unreadable anyway; mistakes of copying;
mistakes of omission ... These are innocent mistakes and with a book the size of
Hitler's War, currently running to 393,000 words, they are not surprising.''<
  He said: ``The allegation that the mistakes are deliberate _ that they are
manipulations or distortions _ is a foul one to make and easily disposed of by
general considerations.''<
