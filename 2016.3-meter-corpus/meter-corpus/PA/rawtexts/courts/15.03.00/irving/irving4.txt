Mr Irving said that he wished, because of the controversy that Hitler's
knowledge of the solution of the Jewish question had generated, that he had
picked upon a different biographical subject.<
Because of the ``inescapable conclusion'' that Hitler had probably not
ordered, or been aware until relatively late, of the ultimate fate of the
European Jews, he forfeited perhaps half a million dollars or more of lucrative
sub-licensing deals with major corporations - the Reader's Digest, paperback
houses, reprints, The Sunday Times.<
Describing the ``30-year international endeavour'' by a group of organisations
to destroy his legitimacy as a historian, he said that Prof Lipstadt had drawn
upon ``these tainted wellsprings'' of dossiers and reports as the source ``for
much of the poison she wrote about me''.<
``I have been subjected since at least 1973 and probably before then to what
would be called in warfare a campaign of interdiction.<
``I know of no other historian or writer who has been subjected to a campaign
of vilification even one tenth as intense. The book Denying the Holocaust was
the climax of this campaign.''<
He said attempts to ``suffocate'' his publishing career had included ``hostile
groups'' applying pressure to major bookselling chains to burn or destroy his
books.<
Leaflets were posted over the West End calling for demonstrations outside his
home.<
``As an indication of the pressure my family was under: the West End Central
Police station telephoned to ask permission to film the interior of my residence
in case we had to be rescued.<
``An officer informed me that they had received information of a planned
attack.<
``For twelve months after our young child was born, we lived with a wicker
Moses basket in the furthest corner of our apartment, near a window, attached to
a length of wire rope in case the building was set on fire and we had to lower
her to safety ... I have lived since then with a four-foot steel spike stowed in
a strategic point inside my apartment.''<
Mr Irving added: ``No historian should have to live with his family in a
civilised city under such conditions. An orchestrated barrage of abuse and death
threats began on my unlisted phone number.''<
