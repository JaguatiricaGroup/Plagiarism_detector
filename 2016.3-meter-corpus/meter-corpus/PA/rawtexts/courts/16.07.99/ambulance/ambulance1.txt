AMBULANCE SERVICE MUST PAY MOTHER #362,377<
By Sarah Westcott, PA News<
A High Court judge today ordered an ambulance service to pay more than a third
of a million pounds to a mother brain damaged after a delayed ambulance call.<
Tracy Kent, 34, was awarded #362,377 in a hearing at Bristol Crown Court where
Mr Justice Turner ruled that the London Ambulance Service had a duty of care to
provide an ambulance within a reasonable time.<
Mrs Kent, an asthmatic, had stopped breathing by the time she reached Queen
Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Kent. She was suffering from an acute asthma attack
50 minutes after the first emergency call was made.<
Mother-of-two Mrs Kent from Orpington, Kent now cannot lead a normal life.<
She was about six weeks into her second pregnancy when she suffered the attack
on the February 16, 1991, which led to a miscarriage.<
She suffered severe memory loss following the attack, did not recognise her
daughter Gemma and her marriage to husband Gary subsequently broke down.<
In a judgment Mr Justice Turner said: ``The residue of the damage to the brain
had left the claimant with severe memory problems in terms of unreliability and
unpredictability. She is able to understand simple letters but requires
assistance for anything more complex.<
``What was never satisfactorily explained is why it took that ambulance 34
minutes to travel the six-and-a-half miles from its base to the claimant's
home.<
``In the absence of any reasonable excuse for this delay I am driven to
conclude that the delay was culpable.<
``The consequences are that in my judgment a period of not less than about 14
minutes was needlessly lost in the process of reaching the claimant's house. As
will be appreciated those minutes had a critical effect on the outcome of the
case.''<
Mrs Kent, of Whitewebbs Way, St Paul's Cray, Kent, was also suing two local
GPs, Dr Yvonne Griffiths and Dr Marian Roberts, alleging they failed properly to
manage and treat her asthma in the run-up to the major attack.<
These claims were dismissed this afternoon.<
Mrs Kent, who had been asthmatic since she was 12 was in a dire condition when
an ambulance was called at 4.25pm on February 16. <
No ambulance arrived until 5.05pm, despite further calls from the doctor and
Mrs Kent's husband.<
By the time she was admitted to casualty at 5.20pm she was recorded as ``not
breathing''.<
She was saved by emergency resuscitation, drugs and eventually an operation to
clear her airways.<
