                17:58 16/07/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Ambulance
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a statement outside court, London Ambulance Service said it ``deeply
regretted the injuries suffered by Mrs Kent''. It added that the claim was
contested ``because the existing case law clearly suggests that the duty of care
owed by Ambulance Services to the public did not extend to the guarantee of time
of arrival''.<
``The LAS intend to study the court's ruling and consider its implications
carefully. However, much has changed in the last eight years since these events
took place.<
``New emergency call-out procedures combined with the latest technology have
resulted in a 14-minute response time being achieved in 90% of cases, an
increase from 62% just five years ago. This improvement has been achieved
against a background of a 30% increase in the number of 999 calls received.<
``The response to increased calls within eight minutes has also dramatically
improved. Last year 239,000 patients benefited from an ambulance arriving within
eight minutes compared with only 59,000 five years ago.<
``The LAS now has a GP Liaison Officer and an established programme to ensure
GPs are aware of the service that is available for their patients and the
information they should give to ensure that the required response is
provided.''<
