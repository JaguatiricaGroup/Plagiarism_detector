ASSAULT-CASE FATHER GETS LIFE AFTER BABY SON DIES<
By Mark Woods, PA News<
A man found guilty of assaulting his baby son, who died 16 months later, was
today jailed for the child's murder in the first case since the abolition of the
``year-and-a-day'' ruling.<
Craig Coleman from Middlesbrough was sentenced to life imprisonment at
Newcastle Crown Court after he pleaded guilty earlier this month to shaking his
four-month-old son to death in February 1997.<
The 30-year-old was jailed for six years at Teesside Crown Court in 1998 after
being committed of causing grievous bodily harm with intent on his son.<
The youngster, also called Craig, survived the assault but was left blind and
deaf, with severe brain damage and epilepsy. He died 16 months after the
incident.<
Coleman would have escaped a murder charge had a law, which prevented an
attacker being charged with murder or manslaughter if his victim remained
clinically alive for a year and a day after the attack, not been changed in June
1997.<
Medical evidence given at the original trial showed that the injuries suffered
by the baby were consistent with a child having been picked up by its ears and
shaken.<
Sentencing Coleman, Mr Justice Moreland, the judge who presided over the James
Bulger case, said he would not set a recommendation for how long Coleman served
until he had considered the circumstances more fully.<
He said: ``It may be some weeks or months before the recommendation is made. I
am going to take time to consider that recommendation.''<
Earlier the judge had indicated that the recommendation for time to be served
would not be in double figures.<
He went on to say: ``This case illustrates the terrible dangers of violently
shaking a baby within temper or a state of exasperation.<
``In February 1998, you were convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with
intent and received six years imprisonment.<
``Your son died in June last year and you have now pleaded guilty to his
murder.<
``I have regard to your plea and the remorse shown by you and will take them
into account in my recommendation to the Home Secretary.<
``But the sentence I must pass is prescribed by law - life imprisonment.''<
 As Coleman wept in the dock, defence barrister Aidan Marron QC, said: ``For a
few moments on a weary winter's morning, the defendant lost control of himself.<
``This is a unique case. No-one has been prosecuted for this offence (GBH with
intent) and then subsequently charged with murder.<
``No man should be punished twice for effectively the same offence. The
child's life was totally devoid of quality - he was frozen in a non-life.<
``What has happened since sentence was passed is that the child has passed
from a living death to an actual death.''<
Mr Marron told of the remorse shown by the defendant since his conviction and
how Coleman had burned his son's name into his arm to ``keep him awake at night,
keep him thinking about the child''.<
