SHOTGUN LADY OF MANOR JAILED FOR THREATENING BAILIFFS<
By Nick Allen, PA News<
A ``Lady of the Manor'' was jailed for nine months today for threatening two
bailiffs with a loaded shotgun.<
Yvonne Amor, 53, pointed the .410 double-barrelled gun at bailiffs Simon Nutt
and Jayne Thompson, Truro Crown Court in Cornwall heard at an earlier trial.<
They had called at Wetherham Manor near Bodmin to seize goods to the value of
#433 in court fines owed by her husband Richard Amor.<
She brandished the shotgun at the bailiffs in the hallway and called police,
threatening to ``get violent'', the court heard.<
Asked if she had called Mrs Thompson a ``whore and prostitute'', she replied:
``I'm sure I was extremely offensive''.<
Mrs Thompson told the court: ``I thought I was going to be shot ... I was
scared for my life''.<
When Mrs Amor was handcuffed, her daughter Sophia, 20, was said to have waved
a hockey stick at police officers. Her other daughter Charlotte, 15, was said to
have tackled a police inspector to try to free her mother.<
Amor, who had said she did not know the gun was loaded and had kept it broken,
was convicted on two charges of threatening the bailiffs with intent to cause
them to believe unlawful violence would be used against them.<
She was acquitted on a charge of assaulting Mrs Thompson.<
In mitigation, Nicholas O'Brien said she was a woman of previous good
character who had brought up three children and was looking after a husband who
was seriously ill with diabetes.<
After giving evidence during the trial, Mr Amor, 68, suffered a heart attack
and had to be flown to hospital.<
Mr O'Brien said the family was experiencing great financial stress and the
bailiffs had acted in a ``heavy-handed'' manner.<
``The bailiffs arriving must have been shocking for her, she had been trying
to fend off that situation for a number of years. That combined with the
provocative behaviour of the bailiffs caused her to act in the way she did,'' he
said.<
He said Mrs Amor felt a great sense of shame during court proceedings.<
Sentencing had to be adjourned for several minutes when she broke down and
sobbed uncontrollably.<
Judge Jeremy Griggs sentenced her to nine months for each of the charges to
run concurrently and said she would serve half that time in prison.<
Mrs Amor's daughters shouted and cried as their mother was led down.<
As she was led down, Mrs Amor said to them: ``Remember you're an Amor.'' <
Judge Griggs said: ``I understand from the pre-sentence report that you are
now somewhat critical of the way you conducted yourself that day, but in no
meaningful way have you shown remorse. There has been no apology to the two
victims who were terrified by your actions.<
``The shotgun was a genuine firearm, it was loaded and it appears that you
deliberately put the cartridges into the barrels of the gun before you came down
the stairs brandishing it and pointing it at the two bailiffs.<
``You had the specific intention of putting officers of the court in danger
while they were carrying out their duties.''<
He said because of her state of mind, notwithstanding the safety catch, there
was a risk of the gun going off ``with consequences which do not bear thinking
about''.<
``The fact that you are the lady who lives in a manor house does not give you
any privileges,'' said the judge.<
``Your behaviour that day was disgraceful and criminal. The example you set
your family was dishonourable, it was shameful.<
``I would be failing in my public duty if I was not to impose immediate
custodial sentences.''<
