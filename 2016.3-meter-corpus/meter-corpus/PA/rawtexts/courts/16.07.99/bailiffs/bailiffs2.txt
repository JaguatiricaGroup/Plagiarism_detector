In a statement tonight Mr Amor said: ``The whole case against my wife is a
joke, it is totally unbelievable.''<
He said the sentencing was ``the culmination of a nightmare and I didn't think
anything could surpass it until today when I heard the judge's reasons for the
sentence''.<
In the quiet village of St Tudy, population around 500, there was a muted
response to the sentence. The Amors' house is at the bottom of a rough, secluded
lane just outside the village.<
Several people described Mrs Amor as ``confrontational''. One source of
friction appears to have been an attempt by Mrs Amor to open her grounds to the
public.<
