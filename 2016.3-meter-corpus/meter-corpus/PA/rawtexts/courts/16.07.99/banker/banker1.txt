BANKER'S BITTERNESS LED TO SYSTEMATIC THEFTS<
By Lyndsay Moss, PA News<
A middle-aged banker who stole more than #270,000 from his bosses because he
resented younger staff being promoted over his head, was jailed for four years
today.<
Trusted Derek Boe, 48, used some of the money to splash out on holidays, buy a
car and a caravan, and pay for expensive home improvements.<
But one of his sunshine breaks proved his undoing, when a colleague who stood
in for him while he was away discovered his ``systematic'' dishonesty.<
London's Southwark Crown Court heard investigators found huge sums had been
funnelled into various accounts and the illicit transactions then concealed with
the benefit of his unparalleled knowledge of Standard Chartered Bank's financial
systems.<
The father of one hung his head as Recorder Nicola Davies QC told him that
only a custodial sentence was suitable given the gravity of the offences.<
She said: ``They involved a substantial breach of trust between yourself and
your employers.''<
She added that the offences represented ``a deliberate and systematic
deception''.<
Boe, of Barnard Road, Chelmsford, Essex, admitted six fraud charges that took
place between December 1993 and April 1998, and asked for 35 similar offences to
be taken into consideration.<
Prosecutor Sandy Canavan said that Boe, who started work at the bank in 1974
and moved to its treasury department in 1987, did not feel the bonuses paid to
him by the bank matched the work and dedication he had put in.<
She said: ``Why he did what he did was because he did not feel he was being
properly recompensed by the bank.''<
Ivor Frank, defending, said that Boe felt he was being ``left on the shelf''
and had ``a burning sense of resentment'' after he passed the age of 40 and was
training much younger recruits who were then overtaking him on the promotion
ladder.<
``He discovered that the firm were taking on a large number of younger men. He
was training them but they were getting much better pay than he was.<
``After a number of years, he hit a mid-life crisis.''<
Explaining how Boe was able to obtain the money so easily, Mr Frank said: ``He
understood the system as no-one else did and was able to exploit weaknesses in
that system.''<
Pleading for leniency, the barrister said his client was now a broken man.<
He had not only lost his home, job and reputation, but his wife had attempted
suicide on learning of her husband's sustained web of deception.<
