BONDI BEACH KILLING VERDICT ANGERS POSTMAN'S FAMILY<
By James Lyons, PA News<
Relatives of a British backpacker killed at Bondi Beach reacted with fury
today when his attacker was cleared of murder.<
Brian Hagland was strolling along a road next to Australia's most famous
stretch of sand with his fiancee, Connie Casey, when he was confronted by a
drunk.<
According to the prosecution, Australian Aaron Lee Martin, 25, punched and
throttled the postman from Cricklewood, north-west London, before throwing him
in front of a bus, on September 7, 1996.<
But after more than a week of deliberations at the New South Wales state
supreme court in Sydney, a jury clear today cleared Martin of murder, finding
him guilty of grievous bodily harm instead.<
The verdict devastated Miss Casey and Mr Hagland's family, who have spent six
weeks in Australia to testify at the trial.<
Parents Brian and Shirley and his two sisters wept as it was announced and
outside the court Miss Casey, a property developer from London, said she was
disappointed by the decision.<
``I had hoped that on my evidence we'd get murder or at least manslaughter,
but that wasn't meant to be,'' she told reporters.<
Miss Casey, 27, said both family and friends had been torn apart by her
fiance's death.<
``Brian was a big part of all our lives, I was with him for seven years and I
haven't been able to move on since it happened,'' she said.<
