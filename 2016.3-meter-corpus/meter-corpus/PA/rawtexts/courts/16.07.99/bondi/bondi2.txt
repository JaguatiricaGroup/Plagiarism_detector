Speaking from his London home 28-year-old Brian's uncle Ron Hagland said the
whole family would be disappointed by the decision.<
``Apparently the autopsy said his injuries from the fight were the cause of
death before the bus hit him and for them to find him guilty of just GBH as if
he had given someone a black eye is unbelievable,'' Mr Hagland said.<
``Brian was just walking along the street, it was totally unprovoked.''<
Mr Hagland added: ``For my part seeing him banged up would not bring
satisfaction. It should be an eye for an eye.''<
The young couple had been in Australia for eight months and were about to
leave for New Zealand, before returning home to England when the attack happened
three years ago.<
Ironically, they funded the trip with cash paid to Miss Casey as compensation
after she was doused with petrol by robbers who threatened to set her on fire.<
They had been for drinks with former colleagues from the Australian Trade
Commission on the night Brian died and were getting off a bus when Martin
approached them, the jury heard.<
Miss Casey broke down as she told how a stranger ``fired up with adrenaline'',
staring wildly and moving aggressively, approached them.<
He knocked down Mr Hagland and began choking him on the road, she said.<
When she went to get help, said the prosecution, Martin shoved her fiance into
the path of the moving bus, causing massive injuries. Mr Hagland died later in
hospital.<
While admitting that he was drunk at the time, Martin told the court he was in
fear of his life.<
He said he made a lewd remark about Miss Casey's breasts but then acted to
save himself from being injured by Mr Hagland when they began wrestling on the
road.<
Denying he was aware of the approaching bus, he told the jury he was in pain
from a bite wound inflicted by Mr Hagland and was ``just trying to get him
away''.<
Martin was found guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm by
strangling and his friend Sean Leigh Cushman, 25, was convicted of being an
accessory after the fact of the assault at the same trial.<
The judge, Justice Carolyn Simpson, offered her condolences to the families of
Hagland and Casey.<
``I hope this ordeal is over for you and you are able to return to your
country and rebuild your lives,'' she said.<
Martin was remanded in custody until sentencing and Cushman was released on
bail. The dates of their sentencing have yet to be set.<
