Martin admitted in that he was drunk when he encountered Mr Hagland and his
fiancee, London property manager Connie Casey, 27.<
The couple had been in Australia for eight months and were about to leave for
New Zealand, before returning home to England.<
After having drinks with former colleagues from the Australian Trade
Commission, they were getting off a bus when Martin approached them, the jury
heard.<
Ms Casey broke down as she told how a stranger ``fired up with adrenalin'',
staring wildly and moving aggressively, approached them.<
He knocked down Mr Hagland and began choking him on the road, she said.<
When she went to get help, said the prosecution, Martin shoved her fiance into
the moving bus, causing massive injuries. Mr Hagland died later in hospital.<
While admitting that he was drunk at the time, Martin told the court he was in
fear of his life.<
He said he made a lewd remark about Ms Casey's breasts but then acted to save
himself from being injured by Mr Hagland when they began wrestling on the road.<
Denying he was aware of the approaching bus, he told the jury he was in pain
from a bite wound inflicted by Mr Hagland and was ``just trying to get him
away''.<
