COURT TO RULE IN LONG-TERM CARE CASE<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
The Court of Appeal will rule today on a legal battle over long-term health
care which could potentially cost the Government ``hundreds of millions of
pounds''.<
North and East Devon Health Authority challenged a High Court ruling last
December that the NHS has a legal duty to provide long-term general nursing care
and cannot shift the responsibility to social services.<
The difference between the two types of care is that the NHS provision is free
but patients in local authority homes can be means-tested and charged for social
services' help and accommodation.<
Wheelchair-bound Pamela Coughlan brought the case against the health authority
over its decision to close Mardon House NHS nursing home in Exeter, where she
had lived since 1993 and had been promised ``a home for life''.<
Mrs Coughlan, 55, who was paralysed from the waist down in a road accident in
1971, and two other residents were told they would be moved to local authority
residential homes and that the social services would be responsible for them.<
Mr Justice Hidden ruled that general nursing care was health care and solely
the responsibility of the NHS and quashed the decision to close the
purpose-built nursing home.<
James Goudie QC, representing the health authority, told the appeal hearing in
May that the ``financial implications'' explained why the legal responsibility
of the NHS for long-term care had been ``a matter of controversy for some
time''.<
He said the effect of the judgment would be that North and East Devon Health
Authority would face extra costs of ``tens of millions'' of pounds for long-term
health care alone.<
``These financial implications would be replicated for health authorities
throughout the nation, requiring an immediate increase in NHS expenditure of
hundreds of millions of pounds.''<
He said the ruling also meant that the current criteria for determining
eligibility for long-term care would have to be abandoned.<
These criteria, issued by the NHS in 1995, distinguished between people
needing specialist care, who came under the NHS, and those who required general
care, who were the social services' responsibility.<
Mr Goudie said the judge should have accepted the ``overriding and
compelling'' reasons allowing the local authority to break its ``home for life''
promise.<
Richard Gordon QC, representing Mrs Coughlan, said the Health Secretary was
trying to make out a case that general nursing care falls outside the scope of
the NHS.<
He said the Health Secretary bore the ``sole responsibility'' for meeting
``any reasonable requirement for nursing services'' under the NHS Act.<
``The Secretary of State cannot lawfully delimit the NHS by guidance to health
authorities.''<
Judgment will be given today by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Woolf, Lord
Justice Mummery and Lord Justice Sedley.<
