NHS SHOULD MEET ALL NURSING COSTS, SAYS RCN<
By James Lyons, PA News<
Nursing chiefs today used an Appeal Court ruling on long-term health care to
renew their calls for all nursing costs to be met by the NHS.<
The Royal College of Nursing had claimed the judgment could end means testing
for long-term patients, currently used to decide whether they or the taxpayer
will foot the bill for nursing care.<
Pippa Gough, the college's director of policy, said she believed the Appeal
Court ruling meant that the NHS was legally liable for the cost of all but the
most minor nursing procedures.<
But she admitted it did nothing to clarify what constituted nursing care, paid
for by the taxpayer, and social care which patients must pay for themselves.<
``It is very difficult to say X is nursing care, and therefore health, and Y
is nursing and therefore social. A hard and fast list is very difficult,'' she
said.<
The RCN claims requiring nursing home residents to meet the costs of some
nursing care amounts to ``silent privatisation'' of the NHS.<
The current system, with health authorities drawing up their own definitions
along with local authorities, has led to a ``care lottery by post code'', it
says.<
Ms Gough said the RCN was unable to suggest its own definitions to clear up
the confusion.<
Instead, she called on Secretary of State Frank Dobson to clarify the
situation facing the ``elderly and vulnerable'' by simply footing the care bills
in full.<
``If people currently in nursing homes were in any other setting, their care
would be free. It is only because the NHS has decided to close down long-term
beds that we are in this situation,'' she said.<
``It would be fairer to say nursing care should be free, whatever the
setting.''<
Ms Gough added: ``Those people have been paying twice and that money is still
in the system. The NHS has shunted that money off into another arena.''<
Mr Dobson welcomed today's ruling precisely because it will allow some nursing
care costs to be directed to social services, and possibly the patients
themselves, rather than the NHS.<
But Helen Caulfield, solicitor and policy adviser at the RCN, insisted that it
was not unrealistic to expect the NHS to pay in full.<
``Any suggestion that it is unrealistic is extremely unfair to people around
the country, not just in nursing homes but also to those who are currently well
and becoming very, very worried about what the future holds for them,'' she
said.<
However, if Mr Dobson did not agree to this proposal, recommended by a Royal
Commission in March, then urgent guidance on exactly what costs patients should
bear was needed, her colleague Ms Gough said.<
``We are very pleased that the court recognised that we are in a confusing and
arbitrary situation out there that needs central guidance.''<
