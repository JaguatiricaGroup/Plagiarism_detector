CASH BACK FOR WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR<
By John Aston, PA News<
Wheelchair-bound Pamela Coughlan spent her life savings fighting for her
``home for life'' - and now should get the vast proportion of the money back.<
Her savings were mostly made up of the #70,000 she received in settlement of
her claim for damages, after being paralysed from the waist down in a road
accident in 1971.<
She ploughed the money into her battle against North and East Devon Health
Authority over its decision to close Mardon House NHS nursing home in Exeter,
where she had lived since 1993.<
She only became entitled to legal aid once the bulk of her savings had been
exhausted.<
Now Mrs Coughlan, 55, is entitled to claw back her money after today's appeal
court ruling that closure of the home was unlawful and she should not be
prejudiced by bringing a case ``raising wide public interest issues''.<
Lord Woolf said she was entitled to all her costs against the health authority
- and Health Secretary Frank Dobson, who intervened in the case, should consider
making ``some contribution to the burden placed on the health authority''.<
Later Mrs Coughlan's solicitor Nicola Mackintosh said: ``She will now get the
vast proportion of it back.<
``She has lost an enormous amount of weight because of the stress of the case.
It has been going on since December 1996 when the health authority first showed
a potential purchaser around.<
``The case she has fought is about the future of the NHS. I think that as a
result, the future of the NHS as a free service to all who need it is now
assured. When I say `free', we are all paying for it.''<
