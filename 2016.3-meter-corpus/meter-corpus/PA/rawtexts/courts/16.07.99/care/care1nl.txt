NHS SPARED `BANKRUPTCY' AFTER CARE DECISION OVERTURNED<
By Maxine Frith and Stephen Howard, PA News<
A legal decision on long-term health care which could have ``bankrupted'' the
NHS was overturned by the Court of Appeal today - meaning that thousands of
people will have to continue paying nursing home fees.<
Three Appeal Court judges ruled that the health service did not have sole
responsibility to provide and fund free long-term care for people who only need
general nursing, rather than specialist treatment and care.<
Health authorities can shift the responsibility for people needing
non-specialist care to social services, which can means-test patients and force
them to pay, the judgment said.<
The judges overturned an earlier High Court ruling that the NHS had a legal
duty to provide free nursing care for everyone.<
The NHS Confederation, which represents health authorities, said the initial
decision could have led to bills of more than #1 billion a year and would have
bankrupted the health service.<
But today North and East Devon Health Authority, backed by the Government, won
its appeal against a case brought by nursing home patient Pamela Coughlan last
year.<
She had claimed that the health authority had acted illegally in closing the
NHS nursing home where she had been promised a ``home for life`` and
transferring her to the responsibility of social services.<
Wheelchair-bound Ms Coughlan brought the case after the health authority
decided to close Mardon House NHS nursing home in Exeter, where she had lived
since 1993.<
Ms Coughlan, 55, who was paralysed from the waist down in a road accident in
1971, and two other residents were told they would be moved to local authority
residential homes and that the social services would be responsible for them.<
Last year High Court judge Mr Justice Hidden ruled that general nursing care
was health care and solely the responsibility of the NHS and quashed the
decision to close the purpose-built nursing home.<
Today's judgment overturned the decision on nursing care but upheld the ruling
that the health authority had acted illegally in closing Mardon House.<
  The decision was hailed as a personal victory for Ms Coughlan but saved the
Government from paying the nursing home bills of more than 40,000 people who are
currently funding their own care.<
However, charities and health authorities said the situation needed to be
clarified.<
Health authorities called on the Government to make the definitions of
``specialist'' and ``nursing'' care clear, warning that the current grey area
was confusing for them and patients.<
Charities want the Government to implement the recommendations of the Royal
Commission on Long Term care which called for universal free medical and
personal care.<
Health Secretary Frank Dobson said: ``I am delighted by this judgment handed
down by the Court of Appeal today.<
He added: ``The judgment makes clear that the current guidance on eligibility
for NHS funded continuing care is lawful.''<
Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation said: ``It seems to
be a pretty sensible judgment.<
``If it had gone the other way it could have bankrupted the NHS and therefore
we are pleased with the decision.<
``But the devil is really in the detail of this case. The existing criteria
for who receives NHS-funded long-term nursing care needs to be clarified and the
judgment does not make that clear.''<
Charities reacted with dismay to the ruling.<
Sally Greengross, director of Age Concern England, said: ``This ruling
perpetuates a fundamental inequality within the health service - the anomaly
whereby people in nursing homes have had to pay for their nursing care when it
is free everywhere else.<
``Nursing care is rightfully a health responsibility and Age Concern has long
argued that nursing care should be free at the point of delivery to all those
who need it, wherever they live.''<
She added: ``This judgment will add to the confusion which characterises the
long-term care system.''<
A spokesman for Help the Aged said: ``This is good news for Ms Coughlan.
Unfortunately it is not going to alter the funding arrangements of vulnerable
older people in nursing care.<
``We were hoping this case would clarify the situation, but the muddled mess
continues.''<
But the Royal College of Nursing claimed the judgment could herald the end of
means-testing for long-term health patients.<
RCN general secretary Christine Hancock said after the hearing: ``Pam
Coughlan's brave decision to fight the closure of her home has brought her
personal success but it should also bring an end to means-testing for nursing
care for tens of thousand of people in nursing homes.<
``The judgment clearly states that North and East Devon Health Authority's
eligibility criteria for long-term NHS health care were unlawful. It rules that
where a patient's primary need for accommodation is a health need, then the
patient's nursing care is the responsibility of the NHS and not the local
authority.<
``Almost by definition, the primary need of the vast majority of people in
nursing homes is a health one.''<
Ms Coughlan was too ill to travel from Devon to hear the judgment in London
today.<
Nichola Mackintosh, her solicitor, welcomed the ruling as ``a great victory
for the chronically sick and disabled''.<
She said: ``This judgment says that if nursing is incidental to nursing home
accommodation, then social services may provide it and means-test it.<
``But if the person's need is a primary need for health care - that will
depend upon the quality and quantity of the person's need - then the health
service must pick up the whole cost.''<
She said that anyone receiving 24-hour nursing care like Ms Coughlan could not
possibly be described as people needing only ancillary and incidental nursing
care.<
