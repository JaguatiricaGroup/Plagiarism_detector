APPEAL COURT CARE RULING `SPARES NHS FROM BANKRUPTCY'<
By Stephen Howard and John Aston, PA News<
The Government was today spared extra NHS bills in long-term health care
estimated at hundreds of millions of pounds a year which could have ``bankrupted
the NHS''.<
The threat was lifted when the Court of Appeal ruled that long-term health
care was not solely the responsibility of the National Health Service which
provides all services free.<
Three Appeal Court judges ruled that health authorities can shift the
responsibility for people needing non-specialist care to social services, which
can means-test patients who would then have to contribute to their care.<
There were immediate calls from charities and local health authorities for
clarification of who will be eligible for free NHS care .<
But despite the ruling which was welcomed by the Government tonight, it did
not prevent wheelchair-bound Pamela Coughlan, 55, from winning a victory in her
battle to save Mardon House nursing home in Exeter which the local authority had
promised would be her ``home for life''.<
North and East Devon Health Authority lost its appeal against a High Court
ruling that it had unlawfully decided to close the home where Mrs Coughlan had
lived since 1993.<
The appeal judges upheld the High Court decision that she was entitled to rely
on the health authority's promise that she would have a home for life.<
Her battle became a test case when the High Court judge, Mr Justice Hidden,
also ruled that not only was the closure unlawful, but the NHS had a legal duty
to provide free long-term nursing care for everyone.<
But the appeal judges overturned Mr Justice Hidden's ruling over the legal
duty issue.<
The Department of Health had intervened in the Appeal Court hearing and today
won concessions from the judges that: ``Nursing care for a chronically sick
patient may in appropriate cases be provided by a local authority as a social
service and the patient may be liable to meet the cost of that care according to
the patient's means.''<
Their judgment continued: ``The provisions of the National Health Service Act
1977 and the National Assistance Act 1948 do not, therefore, make it necessarily
unlawful for the health authority to decide to transfer responsibility for the
general nursing care of Miss Coughlan to the local authority's social
services.''<
The NHS Confederation, which represents health authorities, said the initial
decision could have led to bills of more than #1 billion a year and would have
bankrupted the health service.<
Ms Coughlan, 55, who was paralysed from the waist down in a road accident in
1971, and two other residents were told they would be moved to local authority
residential homes and that the social services would be responsible for them.<
She spent her life savings and all the #70,000 accident damages award on the
case the bulk of which she will now recover.<
Health authorities called on the Government to make the definitions of
``specialist'' and ``nursing'' care clear, warning that the current grey area
was confusing for them and patients.<
Charities want the Government to implement the recommendations of the Royal
Commission on Long Term care which called for universal free medical and
personal care.<
Health Secretary Frank Dobson said: ``I am delighted by this judgment handed
down by the Court of Appeal today.<
He added: ``The judgment makes clear that the current guidance on eligibility
for NHS funded continuing care is lawful.''<
Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: ``It seems
to be a pretty sensible judgment.<
``If it had gone the other way it could have bankrupted the NHS and therefore
we are pleased with the decision.<
``But the devil is really in the detail of this case. The existing criteria
for who receives NHS-funded long-term nursing care needs to be clarified and the
judgment does not make that clear.''<
Charities reacted with dismay to the ruling.<
Sally Greengross, director of Age Concern England, said: ``This ruling
perpetuates a fundamental inequality within the health service _ the anomaly
whereby people in nursing homes have had to pay for their nursing care when it
is free everywhere else.<
``Nursing care is rightfully a health responsibility and Age Concern has long
argued that nursing care should be free at the point of delivery to all those
who need it, wherever they live.''<
She added: ``This judgment will add to the confusion which characterises the
long-term care system.''<
A spokesman for Help the Aged said: ``This is good news for Ms Coughlan.
Unfortunately it is not going to alter the funding arrangements of vulnerable
older people in nursing care.<
``We were hoping this case would clarify the situation, but the muddled mess
continues.''<
But the Royal College of Nursing claimed the judgment could herald the end of
means-testing for long-term health patients.<
RCN general secretary Christine Hancock said after the hearing: ``Pam
Coughlan's brave decision to fight the closure of her home has brought her
personal success but it should also bring an end to means-testing for nursing
care for tens of thousand of people in nursing homes.<
``The judgment clearly states that North and East Devon Health Authority's
eligibility criteria for long-term NHS health care were unlawful. It rules that
where a patient's primary need for accommodation is a health need, then the
patient's nursing care is the responsibility of the NHS and not the local
authority.<
``Almost by definition, the primary need of the vast majority of people in
nursing homes is a health one.''<
Ms Coughlan was too ill to travel from Devon to hear the judgment in London
today.<
Nichola Mackintosh, her solicitor, welcomed the ruling as ``a great victory
for the chronically sick and disabled''.<
She said: ``This judgment says that if nursing is incidental to nursing home
accommodation, then social services may provide it and means-test it.<
``But if the person's need is a primary need for health care - that will
depend upon the quality and quantity of the person's need - then the health
service must pick up the whole cost.''<
She said that anyone receiving 24-hour nursing care like Ms Coughlan could not
possibly be described as people needing only ancillary and incidental nursing
care.<
Lord Woolf said she was entitled to all her costs against the health authority
- and Health Secretary Frank Dobson, who intervened in the case, should consider
making ``some contribution to the burden placed on the health authority''.<
Ms Mackintosh added: ``She will now get the vast proportion of it back.<
``She has lost an enormous amount of weight because of the stress of the case.
It has been going on since December 1996 when the health authority first showed
a potential purchaser around.<
``The case she has fought is about the future of the NHS. I think that as a
result, the future of the NHS as a free service to all who need it is now
assured. When I say `free', we are all paying for it.''<
