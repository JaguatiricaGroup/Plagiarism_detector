A QUESTION OF CARE<
By Maxine Frith, Health Correspondent, PA News<
Today's judgment raises as many questions as it seeks to answer on exactly who
is eligible for free long-term nursing care.<
<
Q: What does the judgment mean?<
A: It states that the NHS does not have sole responsibility for providing and
funding long-term nursing care.<
The judges upheld 1995 guidance to health authorities that the responsibility
for ``general nursing care'' can be shifted to social services, which means
patients can be means-tested and forced to pay for the care they receive.<
``Specialist nursing care'' remains the responsibility of the NHS however, and
is therefore free.<
The judgment upheld an earlier ruling that the health authority had acted
illegally in closing the home where Mrs Coughlan had been promised a place for
life, because it had misinterpreted criteria for long-term care.<
But her victory is essentially a pyrrhic one as it does not stop health
authorities from transferring people from NHS homes to local authority care.<
<
Q: What is the difference between ``general'' and ``specialist'' nursing
care?<
A: This is the grey area that health authorities, charities and patients want
clarified.<
Specialist care is loosely defined as care which requires the services of a
whole medical team, and where a patient's condition can change, needing
different drugs and treatments.<
For instance, someone who has been in a car crash and is paraplegic fulfils
the criteria for specialist care as they will need intensive physiotherapy,
feeding, different drugs and their condition can be volatile. They may also
occasionally require surgery and other invasive treatments.<
A very frail elderly person who needs feeding and occasional treatment for bed
sores will be assessed as needing general nursing care and could therefore be
made to pay for nursing home care.<
But health authorities say there is a grey area where it is difficult to
decide whether someone needs specialist or general care - for instance patients
suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.<
The guidance has also created what charities have said is an ``absurd
anomaly'' where nursing care is free for those in hospital, or receiving help at
home, but means tested for those in a residential home.<
So if you develop cancer your care is free, but if you become senile and need
nursing home care, you must pay.<
<
Q: So what happens at the moment?<
A: There are huge regional variations, as health authorities have interpreted
the guidance differently.<
For instance, in Dundee there are hardly any local authority residential
homes, as most people live in their own homes and receive home helps and other
services, which means their care is paid for.<
But in Newcastle upon Tyne there are many more people in residential homes who
are means tested for their care.<
<
Q: So does the judgment change anything?<
A: Not immediately, but it has opened the debate and put pressure on ministers
to make clear exactly who can expect to receive free long-term care.<
The Royal College of Nursing, charities and health authorities have all called
on the Government for clarification.<
Health Secretary Frank Dobson said today that the Government was reviewing the
situation.<
Charities want the Government to implement proposals from the Royal Commission
on Long-Term Care that all care - including medical and personal - should be
free.<
But health authorities say this could cost up to #1.2 billion a year and the
Government has not yet responded to the Royal Commission report.<
The authorities are worried that if the Government changes the criteria for
qualification for specialist nursing care, elderly people with dementia and more
general nursing needs could be eligible and massively increase the burden on the
NHS.<
