COURT RULING SPARES GOVERNMENT HUGE CARE BILL<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
The Government was spared extra NHS bills estimated at hundreds of millions of
pounds a year today after a Court of Appeal judgment on long-term health care.<
But the Master of the Rolls, Lord Woolf, and two other appeal judges dismissed
the appeal by a health authority against the ruling that its closure of a care
home was unlawful.<
The Health Secretary joined the legal battle after the High Court decided last
December that the NHS has a legal duty to provide free long-term general nursing
care and cannot shift the responsibility to social services which can means test
patients.<
Wheelchair-bound Pamela Coughlan brought the case against North and East Devon
Health Authority over its decision to close Mardon House NHS nursing home in
Exeter, where she had lived since 1993 and had been promised ``a home for
life''.<
Mrs Coughlan, 55, who was paralysed from the waist down in a road accident in
1971, and two other residents were told they would be moved to local authority
residential homes and that the social services would be responsible for them.<
High Court judge Mr Justice Hidden ruled that general nursing care was health
care and solely the responsibility of the NHS and quashed the decision to close
the purpose-built nursing home.<
Health Secretary Frank Dobson said: ``I am delighted by this judgment handed
down by the Court of Appeal today.<
``The sole reason why the Department of Health intervened in this case was to
ask the court to clarify the powers of social services authorities to make
arrangements for the provision of nursing care.<
``This judgment confirms that social services authorities may make such
arrangements and confirms our understanding of the current legal position.<
``It safeguards the funding for tens of thousands of elderly and vulnerable
people in nursing homes.''<
He added: ``The judgment makes clear that the current guidance on eligibility
for NHS funded continuing care is lawful.<
``We already have a commitment to review this guidance, issued in 1995, by the
previous Government, We will do so in the light of this judgment,'' added Mr
Dobson.<
James Goudie QC, representing the health authority, told the appeal hearing in
May that the ``financial implications'' explained why the legal responsibility
of the NHS for long-term care had been ``a matter of controversy for some
time''.<
He said the effect of the High Court judgment would be that North and East
Devon Health Authority would face extra costs of ``tens of millions'' of pounds
for long-term health care alone.<
``These financial implications would be replicated for health authorities
throughout the nation, requiring an immediate increase in NHS expenditure of
hundreds of millions of pounds.''<
