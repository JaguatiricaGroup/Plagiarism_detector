  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 157,500 people receiving long term nursing care in England, 42,500 of
whom pay for their own care.<
The Age Concern charity had predicted that if the Government had lost the
case, it could have cost an extra #220 million a year to provide care for those
people.<
Charities are now calling on the Government to implement proposals from the
Royal Commission on Long Term Care that all care, both medical and personal,
should be free.<
Experts have said that implementing those recommendations could cost up to #1
billion a year.<
