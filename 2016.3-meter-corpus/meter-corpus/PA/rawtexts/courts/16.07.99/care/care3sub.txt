  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Goudie told the appeal hearing in May that the ruling also meant that the
current criteria for determining eligibility for long-term care would have to be
abandoned.<
These criteria, issued by the NHS in 1995, distinguished between people
needing specialist care, who came under the NHS, and those who required general
care, who were the social services' responsibility.<
Mr Goudie said the judge should have accepted the ``overriding and
compelling'' reasons allowing the local authority to break its ``home for life''
promise.<
Lord Woolf, Lord Justice Mummery and Lord Justice Sedley agreed that the legal
battle over the closure of Mardon House ``raised other legal points which had
far reaching implications'' about the responsibility of the Health Service and
of social services.<
Today they dismissed the appeal by the health authority but ruled that the NHS
does not have sole responsibility for all nursing care.<
``Nursing care for a chronically sick patient may in appropriate cases be
provided by a local authority as a social service and the patient may be liable
to meet the cost of that care according to the patient's means.''<
Their judgment goes on: ``The provisions of the National Health Service Act
1977 and the National Assistance Act 1948 do not, therefore, make it necessarily
unlawful for the health authority to decide to transfer responsibility for the
general nursing care of Miss Coughlan to the local authority's social
services.''<
