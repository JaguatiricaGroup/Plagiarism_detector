  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Royal College of Nursing claimed the judgment could herald the end of
means-testing for long-term health patients.<
RCN general secretary Christine Hancock said after the hearing: ``Pam
Coughlan's brave decision to fight the closure of her home has brought her
personal success but it should also bring an end to means-testing for nursing
care for tens of thousand of people in nursing homes.<
``The judgment clearly states that North and East Devon Health Authority's
eligibility criteria for long-term NHS health care were unlawful. It rules that
where a patient's primary need for accommodation is a health need, then the
patient's nursing care is the responsibility of the NHS and not the local
authority.<
``Almost by definition, the primary need of the vast majority of people in
nursing homes is a health one.<
``The judgment also indicates that the Department of Health's eligibility
criteria guidance issued in 1995 had shortcomings and was the basis of the flaws
in the health authority's criteria. This means there are likely to be many other
health authorities who are employing unlawful criteria to determine who should
receive long-term NHS nursing care.''<
``The Secretary of State must now act decisively to clarity patients' rights
to long-term nursing care. The simplest, fairest and most cost-effective
solution would be to entitle all those assessed as needing long-term nursing
care to receive that care free under the NHS, wherever it is provided.<
``It would cost the NHS only #220 million per year, less than half a per cent
of its total budget. And it would pay dividends, not just in terms of reducing
distress to patients and their families, but in terms of integrating health care
planning.''<
She said the RCN had now written to the Health Secretary to press for clarity
urgently.<
``Across the nation people in or waiting to move in to nursing homes, and
their families, will be worried and confused about where this judgment leaves
them.''<
