Nichola Mackintosh, Mrs Coughlan's solicitor, welcomed the ruling as ``a great
victory for the chronically sick and disabled''.<
``This judgment says that if nursing is incidental to nursing home
accommodation, then social services may provide it and means test it.<
``But if the person's need is a primary need for health care - that will
depend upon the quality and quantity of the person's need - then the health
service must pick up the whole cost.''<
She said that anyone receiving 24-hour nursing care like Mrs Coughlan could
not possibly be described as people needing only ancillary and incidental
nursing care.<
