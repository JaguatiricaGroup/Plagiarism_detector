Sally Greengross, director of Age Concern England, said: ``This ruling
perpetuates a fundamental inequality within the health service - the anomaly
whereby people in nursing homes have had to pay for their nursing care when it
is free everywhere else.<
``Nursing care is rightfully a health responsibility and Age Concern has long
argued that nursing care should be free at the point of delivery to all those
who need it, wherever they live.''<
She added: ``This judgment will add to the confusion which characterises the
long-term care system.''<
A spokesman for Help the Aged said: ``This is good news for Ms Coughlan.
Unfortunately it is not going to alter the funding arrangements of vulnerable
older people in nursing care.<
``We were hoping this case would clarify the situation, but the muddled mess
continues.<
``Thousands of people are desperate for a clear policy on how we fund
long-term care. The sooner the Government responds to the Royal Commission's
recommendations, the better.''<
Mrs Coughlan was too ill to travel from Devon to hear the judgment in London
today.<
