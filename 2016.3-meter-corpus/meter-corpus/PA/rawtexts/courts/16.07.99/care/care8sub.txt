Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents all
health authorities, said: ``It seems to be a pretty sensible judgment.<
``If it had gone the other way it could have bankrupted the NHS and therefore
we are pleased with the decision.<
``But the devil is really in the detail of this case. The existing criteria
for who receives NHS-funded long term nursing care needs to be clarified and the
judgment does not make that clear.''<
Health Secretary Mr Dobson has said the Government was reviewing the situation
in the wake of today's judgment.<
Mr Thornton added: ``If the Government lowers the criteria there could still
be huge cost implications for the NHS.''<
