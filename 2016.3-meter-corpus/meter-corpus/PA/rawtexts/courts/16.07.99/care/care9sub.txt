Shadow Health Minister Philip Hammond said: ``Today's Appeal Court ruling on the
case of Pamela Coughlan underlines the urgent need for a Government response on
the Royal Commission long term care of the elderly report.<
``Labour in opposition said they would deal as a matter of urgency with the
problem of long term care funding.<
``Once in Government they used the Royal Commission to delay any decision for
two years and now they are delaying again.''<
He added: ``What those concerned about long term care will want to know now is
when we can expect a considered response from Frank Dobson on the Royal
Commission report, not to mention a clear statement of government policy on this
important issue.''<
