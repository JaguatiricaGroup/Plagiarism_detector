YEAR'S JAIL FOR SOCCER FAN WHO RACIALLY ABUSED PLAYER<
By Michael Bristow, PA News<
A football fan was jailed for a year today for racially abusing a black player
after invading the pitch during a match.<
Swansea City fan Neil Roberts called Brighton striker Michael Bennett a
``nigger'' at the Welsh team's home ground during a Third Division clash on
February 5, Swansea Crown Court was told.<
Roberts, 30, was convicted by the jury of a new offence of putting Bennett in
fear while being racially motivated.<
Bill Peters, prosecuting, said trouble flared when Swansea player Julian Alsop
was sent off after clashing with a Brighton player.<
Two Swansea City supporters ran on to the pitch, with one of them _ Roberts _
heading straight for Bennett.<
Bennett told the jury he thought he was going to be attacked, but a Swansea
player prevented Roberts from getting too close.<
Roberts, of Gwynedd Avenue, Townhill, Swansea, admitted running on to the
pitch and calling Bennett a ``nigger''.<
But he denied the words were racially motivated and argued they were no more
offensive than saying someone had a big nose.<
Roberts, who was escorted off the pitch after the incident, was also banned
from any football league ground for three years.<
