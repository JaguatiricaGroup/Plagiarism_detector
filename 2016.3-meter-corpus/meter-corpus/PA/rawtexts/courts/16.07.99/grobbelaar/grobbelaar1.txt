GROBBELAAR AND TRUTH `STRANGE BEDFELLOWS', QC TELLS JURY<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Bruce Grobbelaar and the truth made ``strange bedfellows'', QC George Carman
told a High Court libel jury today.<
Opening The Sun's defence to the former Liverpool star's action over a series
of November 1994 articles alleging match-fixing, Mr Carman branded the
goalkeeper ``a serial liar''.<
``Where stands the law, when he who seeks to pollute the fountain of justice
is asking the jury to compensate him with money?''<
He told the seven men and five women on the jury that the ``cancer of
corruption'' in English football would be a very grave matter if it occurred.<
Like cancer, it might take root, and - if it were known to be available to
people who might make enormous sums of money out of it - it could spread.<
He urged the jury to put aside prejudice and sympathy.<
Mr Grobbelaar sat staring straight ahead, alongside his wife Debbie, as the QC
added: ``There are features in this case where you would not be human did you
not have some sympathy for Mrs Grobbelaar, and it doesn't need words of mine to
explain to you why that sympathy might be aroused.''<
Mr Carman said that the case had revealed ``a somewhat dark side'' to Mr
Grobbelaar - ``a degree of intrigue, a fondness for deception and an interest in
money''.<
The Sun has alleged that he took #40,000 to make sure Liverpool lost to
Newcastle and had blown his chance of #125,000 more in a game against Manchester
United by accidentally making a sensational save.<
The newspaper denies libel, claiming justification and qualified privilege.<
The civil action comes after two criminal trials at Winchester Crown Court in
1997 - the first ended in deadlock _ which resulted in Grobbelaar being cleared
of conspiracy, along with ex-Wimbledon stars John Fashanu and Hans Segers, and
businessman Richard Lim.<
Mr Carman told the jury that there were eight ``signposts'' that might guide
them as to where the truth lay.<
:: Mr Grobbelaar began his case by lying to his own lawyers about the
existence of Mr Lim, going to Fashanu's house and a midnight trip to see Lim.<
:: He presented a formal document to the High Court containing those lies.<
:: He lied to a team-mate to cover up the midnight trip.<
:: He told a series of lies to Sun journalists when confronted.<
:: He ``lived something of a lie to his own wife'' by concealing from her his
business relationship and secret activities with former partner Chris Vincent.<
:: He said that what he was recorded as saying on The Sun's secret video tapes
- which supported their articles to the hilt - was a ``lethal cocktail of lies,
half-truths and occasionally the truth''.<
:: The lack of a ``hint of shame or remorse or guilt'' over the lies.<
:: The lack of any evidence from Mr Fashanu and Mr Lim who ``at a stroke''
would have been able to give Mr Grobbelaar ``a certificate of innocence''.<
``Members of the jury'', said Mr Carman, ``the truth and Bruce Grobbelaar
unhappily make strange bedfellows.''<
