               13:29 16/07/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Grobbelaar
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Carman said that The Sun only had to prove that Mr Grobbelaar had entered
into a dishonest agreement to take money and take it on the basis he was
entering into an agreement to act corruptly in matches.<
It would be a ``virtual impossibility'', said counsel, to prove conclusively -
apart from his own confession - how a highly skilled goalkeeper carefully
selected perhaps one match in a season to cheat and obtain for himself #100,000
or #50,000.<
But, he added, the jury did have Mr Grobbelaar's detailed confession about it
(on the tapes) and the fact that he did take #2,000 (from Mr Vincent who
colluded with The Sun) and kept it.<
Mr Grobbelaar has said that he intended to hand it over to the authorities.<
Mr Carman said that the newspaper regarded Mr Vincent as a ``wholly unreliable
witness'' and was not proposing to call him to give evidence.<
The newspaper preferred to rely on the evidence of the tapes and of Mr
Grobbelaar, his wife and of fellow goalkeeper Bob Wilson, who told the court
that he would have reported any offer of a corrupt deal.<
Mr Grobbelaar has said that he only made the match-fixing comments on the
tapes to Vincent, whom he distrusted, to string him along in a bid to gather
evidence to expose him as corrupt.<
He has described his plan to go it alone against Vincent as ``the worst
decision of my life''.<
Mr Carman said that it was an irony of the case that Mr Grobbelaar who was
``virtually by his own confession a serial liar, a man who lies whenever it's
convenient and in his self-interest so to do'' was accusing The Sun of
publishing something that it knew to be false.<
His claim, on that basis, for punitive exemplary damages was
``extraordinary''.<
Vincent, who approached The Sun in early September 1994, and who was paid
#30,000, was the ``trigger'' for the articles, but the newspaper did not rely on
him and tested the truth of his story before going into print.<
Mr Carman said it was ``truly amazing'' that on the tapes, Mr Vincent's story
to the journalists was confirmed by Mr Grobbelaar's own words.<
``He was condemned out of his own mouth on the tapes.''<
Mr Grobbelaar, he added, was given a ``golden opportunity'' to preserve his
good name and tell the newspaper the truth but he refused to do so.<
Far from publishing what it knew to be false, said Mr Carman, the newspaper
took great care to try and establish that what it was going to publish was
true.<
