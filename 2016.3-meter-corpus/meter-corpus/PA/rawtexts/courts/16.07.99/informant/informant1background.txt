INFORMANT'S MURDER TIP-OFF GAVE AWAY HIS GUILT<
By Maria Breslin, PA News<
The vicious murder of an elegant widow found in the bedroom of her detached
home may have forever remained a mystery had the killer not inexplicably
volunteered information to police.<
Kevin Morrison, a police informant, coolly relayed previously unpublicised
details of the brutal killing to baffled officers before trying to pin the blame
on another man.<
The 1996 murder of pensioner Alice Rye perplexed detectives. Despite
questioning up to 6,000 people, taking 1,200 statements and mounting a national
appeal on BBC's Crimewatch, 18 months on they seemed no nearer to catching her
killer.<
A security-conscious 74-year-old, the mother-of-three was a familiar figure
around the respectable Merseyside suburb of Spital where she had lived for
almost 40 years. She was often seen behind the wheel of her grey M-reg Renault
Clio car.<
After the death of her husband Colin, a company director, in 1986, Mrs Rye's
life revolved around her family - particularly her children Derek, who lived in
South Africa and daughters Davina, a former dancer with the Royal Ballet, and
Rowena both based in the south of England.<
The widow, who grew up in Anglesey, North Wales, was the epitome of
respectability - a member of the Women's Institute and a regular worshipper at
the Holy Trinity Church where the Rev Justin Mote described her as ``a lady with
poise, dignity and elegance''.<
Yet Mrs Rye's death was anything but dignified. Her semi-naked and mutilated
body was found on December 11 by elderly neighbours Phyllis Kellett and Geoffrey
Howarth upstairs in her four-bedroomed home.<
Her hands were bound with blue nylon rope, there was a ligature around her
neck and a wet pink bathroom towel had been stuffed into Mrs Rye's mouth. She
had been stabbed several times in the chest - with one wound fatally piercing
her heart.<
When Kevin Morrison, then 58, approached police some 18 months after the
murder he began to divulge details to ``whet the appetite'' of officers. He told
his ``handler'' about two small knives and claimed he had been given a Seiko
watch.<
Yet despite numerous high profile press appeals, detectives never revealed
that two small kitchen knives had been plunged into Alice Rye's eye sockets nor
that a Seiko watch with a cracked face was among jewellery missing from her
Poulton Road home.<
Morrison was born, bred and educated in Birkenhead, Wirral, but expelled from
the town's St Anselm's RC Grammar School at the age of 13 when he made the first
of many appearances before the courts.<
One of nine children born to an Irish mother and Birkenhead father, he
embarked on a life of petty crime picking up convictions for burglary, theft,
handling stolen goods, possession of an offensive weapon, criminal damage and
public order offences along the way.<
For much of his adult life he roamed around England and Ireland, doing his
National Service in the Royal Signal Corps. A keen gardener and horticulturist,
with a number of qualifications under his belt, he was often employed as a
groundsman, at times working at golf clubs and at a London university.<
Married in 1962 and divorced 19 years later Morrison had no contact with his
ex-wife and two daughters who settled in the Monmouth area of South Wales.
Around the time of Alice Rye's death he was living with his eldest daughter
Angela, 34, in a caravan in the Cheshire village of Kelsall.<
In interviews Morrison, known as Mogsy, portrayed himself as an intelligent,
educated and well-read man. It was his conscience, he claimed, which led him to
``grass'' on an acquaintance called Keith Darlington and accuse him of the
murder of the Wirral widow.<
He even taunted detectives saying: ``You are going to be convinced that I have
done the murder or the fella I will tell you about has done the murder.<
``It could only be me or someone else who told it to me or someone else who
was with me,'' he told officers.<
Alice Rye died because she was a widow, living alone in an affluent area of
the Wirral who despite being sexually tortured refused to divulge the security
details of her bank cards. Ironically as an ``old-fashioned'' banker, she did
not have a PIN number to pacify her cruel killer.<
She was selected from the electoral register by a calculated Morrison who
carrying a briefcase managed to con his way into her home - a home described by
the victim's sister Ann Lemin, who still lives on Anglesey, as being like ``Fort
Knox''.<
Morrison murdered Mrs Rye because he believed she could identify him. He
placed knives in her eye sockets to throw detectives off the trail knowing a
psychological profile would be drawn up of the killer.<
And as a final insult to the fiercely independent and immaculately dressed
widow, he took the Marks & Spencer knickers she was wearing at the time of her
death as a trophy.<
Described during the nine-day trial as ``a lunatic, a cruel man and a man of
some sexual oddity'', Morrison subscribed to a contact magazine and readily
admitted regularly wearing second-hand women's underwear.<
A plastic bag containing 15 pairs of knickers, including those belonging to
Alice Rye, were found in a lock-up garage rented by Morrison in the Cheshire
town of Ellesmere Port.<
When first sent for trial Morrison also faced a further 22 charges unconnected
with the murder of Alice Rye. He stood accused of five counts of rape, five
indecent assaults, five serious sexual assaults, three charges of theft, one of
burglary, one charge of handling stolen goods, one of evading payment and one of
deception.<
