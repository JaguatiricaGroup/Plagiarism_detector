LIFE FOR `EVIL' INFORMANT WHO MURDERED WIDOW<
By Maria Breslin, PA News<
A police informant who murdered and mutilated an elegant widow and then tried
to cash in on his crime was jailed for life today.<
Kevin Joseph Morrison bound and gagged mother-of-three Alice Rye, 74, after
conning his way into her detached home, stabbing her several times and fatally
piercing her heart.<
Almost 18 months later he volunteered information to the police ``whetting
their appetite'' by divulging previously unpublicised details about her death.<
Morrison, 60, formerly of the Pinfold Centre, in Poole, near Nantwich,
Cheshire, stood impassively in the dock at Liverpool Crown Court as Mr Justice
Douglas Brown described him ``a truly evil man''.<
He said: ``The jury have convicted you of a wicked murder. It was obviously
planned and carried out in a cruel and ruthless manner.<
``What made you submit yourself to the scrutiny of the police may never be
known for certain.<
``You obviously wanted a reward and a substantial reward, and you took the
chance that after 18 months nothing would connect you with this murder.<
``You callously accused an innocent man causing him great distress. And those
allegations were of course entirely false and were shown to be by forensic
scientists.<
``That those allegations were false were demonstrated with great skill by the
forensic science service to whose application and perseverance the public owe a
considerable debt.<
``Your gamble failed because of forensic scientists and the diligent work of a
detective. You are a truly evil man and you are also in my view, on the evidence
given, very dangerous,'' the judge added.<
Morrison, wearing grey jogging bottoms, a beige and brown cardigan and white
T-shirt, showed no emotion as he was led down to the cells.<
The jury of nine women and three men returned a unanimous guilty verdict on
the former groundsman after more than three hours' deliberation.<
During the 10-day trial they heard Mrs Rye had lived alone at the four bedroom
house in Poulton Road, Spital, Wirral, Merseyside, since the death of her
company director husband Colin in 1986.<
Her body was found early on December 11, 1996, by elderly neighbours Geoffrey
Howarth and Phyllis Kellett, who became anxious after discovering the
pensioner's double gates left open overnight.<
Mrs Rye was semi-naked on a single bed in an upstairs back bedroom, her hands
bound by a blue nylon rope, a pink towel forced into her mouth and a ligature
fashioned from an old bandage hanging around her neck.<
Two small black-handled kitchen knives were pushed into the sockets of her
eyes and she had been sexually tortured.<
Although there was no signs of a break-in at Mrs Rye's home a search revealed
jewellery, including a rare 14 carat South African gold watch, bank cards and a
bus pass were missing.<
Morrison first volunteered information to police about a ``job on the Wirral''
in May 1998 - a month later ``whetting their appetite'' by revealing insider
knowledge about the two black knives.<
He named acquaintance Keith Darlington as the widow's killer and in return for
further details demanded money, protection and a new address from police who
were offering a #5,000 reward.<
Morrison claimed he was asked to look after a parcel by the murderer which he
alleged contained items belonging to Mrs Rye. Neither the broken bread knife he
claimed to have buried or a bracelet he threw in the Manchester Ship Canal have
ever been recovered.<
Throughout the trial Morrison maintained Mr Darlington was the murderer,
selecting his victim from the electoral roll at a local library and killing her
when she refused to reveal the security details of her bank card.<
The jury heard that although there was no evidence in Mrs Rye's house to link
Morrison to the scene, there was only a one in 69 million chance that knickers
found in his rented lock-up garage did not belong to his victim.<
There was a one in 7.6 million chance that semen stains found on the
undergarment were not Morrison's.<
The odd-job man was described in court as ``a lunatic, a cruel man and a man
some sexual oddity'' who readily admitted wearing second-hand women's
underwear.<
Although robbery was widely believed to be the motive for Mrs Rye's murder, a
source close to the investigation said he believed it to be ``100% sexual''.<
Sex charges and dishonesty charges also brought against Morrison were allowed
to lie on the file at the order of the judge.<
In a statement released after the hearing Mrs Rye's family paid tribute the
police's tenacity and determination.<
``We would like to thank the Wirral community for their help throughout the
investigation by the police and to extend our appreciation to Merseyside Police
for their tenacity and determination in tracing this man.<
``We now have the difficult task of getting on with our lives and we would ask
for our privacy to be respected,'' the statement said.<
