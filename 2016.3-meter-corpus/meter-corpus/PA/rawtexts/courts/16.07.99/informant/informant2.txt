Sentencing the divorced father-of-three, the judge said: ``The jury have
convicted you of a wicked murder. It was obviously planned and carried out in a
cruel and ruthless manner.<
``What made you submit yourself to the scrutiny of the police may never be
known for certain.<
``You obviously wanted a reward and a substantial reward, and you took the
chance that after 18 months nothing would connect you with this murder.<
``You callously accused an innocent man causing him great distress. And those
allegations were of course entirely false and were shown to be by forensic
scientists.<
``That those allegations were false were demonstrated with great skill by the
forensic science service to whose application and perseverance, the public owe a
considerable debt.<
``Your gamble failed because of forensic scientists and the diligent work of
detectives.<
``You are a truly evil man and you are also in my view, on the evidence given,
very dangerous,'' the judge added.<
Morrison, wearing grey jogging bottoms, a beige and brown cardigan and white
T-shirt, showed no emotion as he was led down to the cells.<
