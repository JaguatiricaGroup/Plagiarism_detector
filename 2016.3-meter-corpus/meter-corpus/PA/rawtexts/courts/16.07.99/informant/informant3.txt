The jury of nine women and three men, returned a guilty verdict on the former
gardener, groundsman and taxi driver, after more than three hours deliberation.<
During the harrowing ten-day trial they heard how Mrs Rye had lived alone at
the four-bedroomed house in Poulton Road, Spital, Wirral, Merseyside, since the
death of her company director husband Colin in 1986.<
Her body was found early on December 11, 1996, by elderly neighbours Geoffrey
Howarth and Phylis Kellett who became anxious after discovering the pensioner's
double gates left open overnight.<
Mrs Rye was lying semi naked on a single bed in an upstairs back bedroom, her
hands bound by blue nylon rope, a pink towel forced into her mouth and a
ligature fashioned from an old bandage hanging around her neck.<
Two small black handled kitchen knives had been pushed into the sockets of the
widows eyes.<
Although there were no signs of a break-in at Mrs Rye's home, a search
revealed jewellery, including a rare 14-carat South African gold watch, bank
cards and a bus pass were missing.<
