Morrison first volunteered information to officers about a ``job on the Wirral''
in May 1998 - a month later ``whetting their appetite'' divulging previously
unpublished details about the crime.<
He named acquaintance Keith Darlington as the widow's killer and in return for
further details, demanded money, protection and a new address from police.<
Morrison claimed he was asked to look after a parcel by the murderer which he
later discovered contained items belonging to Rye.<
Neither the broken bread knife he claimed to have buried or a bracelet he
allegedly threw in the Manchester Ship Canal, have ever been found.<
Throughout the trial, Morrison maintained that Keith Darlington had selected
Alice Rye from the electoral register, eventually killing his victim when she
refused to reveal her security details.<
The jury heard that although there was no evidence in Mrs Rye's house to link
Morrison to the scene, there was only a one in 69 million chance that knickers
found in his rented lock up garage did not belong to the elderly victim.<
There was a one in 7.6 million chance that semen stains found on the
undergarment were not Morrisons.<
The murderer, described in court as ``a lunatic, a cruel man and a man of some
sexual oddity'', readily admitted wearing second-hand women's underwear.<
Although the court heard that the motive behind the murder was robbery, some
experts have suggested it showed all the signs of ritualistic sexual killing.<
