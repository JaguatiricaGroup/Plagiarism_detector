`DESPICABLE' KILLER OF BRILLIANT RESEARCHER JAILED<
By Melvyn Howe, PA News<
A ``despicable'' killer whose pursuit of a ``macho image'' left a brilliant
Cambridge researcher dying on a towpath was jailed for 30 months today.<
With just one punch Lee Tate, 23, knocked his 30-year-old victim to the
ground, causing him to strike his head on the path and fracture his skull.<
Then as Seung Jun Lee lay unconscious in his sobbing wife's arms, his attacker
punched and kicked him in the face.<
One of his pals, Earl Petrie, 24, who received 12 months, then ``piled in'',
also striking the helpless man.<
Meanwhile, a third defendant, Mark Picard, 25, attacked one of Mr Lee's
friends when he went to the stricken man's aid. He was jailed for three months.<
Southwark Crown Court Judge George Bathurst-Norman told Tate - who was earlier
cleared of murder, convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm and who
today admitted manslaughter - that his behaviour had been ``simply appalling''.<
The men's trial at the Old Bailey heard Mr Lee had been taking a sunny evening
stroll beside the River Thames at Kingston when Tate pushed an empty buggy into
his wife's legs.<
When the Korean-born researcher pulled it away, Tate, from Acton, west London,
delivered a single punch that was so hard his victim fell back ``like a log''.<
As Mr Lee's wife Nan-Joo tried to comfort her fatally injured husband, Tate
continued to attack him.<
She later told police: ``I said, `My husband is dying, please stop'.''<
The judge told Tate that ``there could be absolutely no excuse'' for what he
did.<
He had tried to ``boost some kind of macho image''.<
``It was wholly shameful and despicable that once you had knocked him to the
ground you decided to pursue that attack against him,'' he added.<
The judge said that although he had initially considered passing a higher
sentence, he now felt, having consulted legal authorities, that the correct term
of imprisonment was two-and-a-half years.<
