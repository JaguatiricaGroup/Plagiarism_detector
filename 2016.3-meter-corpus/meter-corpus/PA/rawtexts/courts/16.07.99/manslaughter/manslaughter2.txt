He then turned to Petrie, of Eureka Road, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, who was
convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm on Mr Lee.<
``You saw Tate knock Mr Lee to the ground. I am quite satisfied that it must
have been very, very clear to you ... that there was no further threat from
him.<
``Yet you couldn't resist the opportunity to pile in and assault him ... it
doesn't matter whether it is a friend who is attacking, this man was helpless on
the ground,'' he said.<
Dealing with Picard, of Cambridge Gardens, Kingston-upon-Thames, who was
convicted of causing Mr Lee's friend, Ki Joon Jin, actual bodily harm, the judge
said the ``most serious aspect'' of his involvement was the way he prevented the
man from going to the aid of his unconscious friend.<
''You then hit him, as you accepted in evidence, in temper,'' he said.<
The court heard that all three men gave themselves up to police after hearing
that Mr Lee, who was doing a PhD at Cambridge, had died in hospital five days
after the attack.<
At the end of the men's trial the judge backed criticism of police by Mr Lee's
widow about the way officers reacted when they first arrived.<
``I find it greatly disturbing, as do the public as a whole, to find police
officers in complete ignorance of events committed and arrive at the scene and
reject outright what they have been told by eye witnesses as to what the
position is, then jumping through their ignorance to a false position which in
some cases could cost lives,'' he said.<
He also criticised their lack of first aid knowledge in not recognising
``classic symptoms'' of head injuries, which he said was ``deplorable''.<
A Scotland Yard spokesman said at the time that the matter was the subject of
a ``complete investigation'' by the Police Complaints Authority.<
After today's hearing, case officer Detective Inspector Mark Veljovic said:
``This was a vicious, totally unprovoked cowardly attack on a group of friends
who had been enjoying a pleasant and peaceful day out.<
``All three defendants have quite rightly been given terms of imprisonment for
their part in the attack on Mr Lee.''<
Mr Lee's widow, who was in court, left refusing to comment.<
