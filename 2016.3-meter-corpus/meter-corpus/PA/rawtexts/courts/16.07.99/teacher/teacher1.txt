TEACHER TO BE SENTENCED ON INDECENT PHOTOS CHARGES<
By Matthew Cooper, PA News<
A former public school maths teacher will appear in court today to be
sentenced for taking indecent photographs of young boys.<
John Skermer, 51, a teacher at King Henry VIII School in Coventry, is due to
appear before Warwick Crown Court after magistrates decided their powers of
punishment were insufficient.<
Skermer last month admitted using an underwater camera to photograph boys
swimming in thongs and taking pictures of partially-clothed pupils in changing
rooms after a rugby match.<
Coventry magistrates committed Skermer to crown court for sentencing after
hearing that he had perpetrated a ``gross breach of trust''.<
Skermer, who was head of year seven at the prestigious #4,500-a-year school,
has also pleaded guilty to taking pictures of a boy on a beach in Wales and two
youngsters fishing beside a lake in Northamptonshire.<
The teacher, who has admitted four charges of taking indecent photographs and
five charges of possessing them, committed the offences between 1980 and April
this year.<
Skermer, of Allesley Road, Allesley, Coventry, resigned his post in May and
has been granted bail to an address in Devizes, Wiltshire.<
