SUSPENDED SENTENCE FOR TEACHER WHO TOOK UNDERWATER PICTURES<
By Matthew Cooper, PA News<
A former public school maths teacher who used an underwater camera to take
indecent photographs of young boys swimming in thongs today walked free from
court.<
John Skermer, 51, a teacher at King Henry VIII School in Coventry, amassed
1,200 indecent images over more than a decade, including pictures of
partly-clothed pupils in changing rooms after a rugby match, Warwick Crown Court
heard.<
Sentencing Skermer to a three-month jail term suspended for one year, Judge
Richard Cole said none of the youngsters' pictured had been corrupted by the
teacher's actions.<
Judge Cole, sitting with two magistrates, said there had been ``no suggestion
of a child being in any way intimidated or frightened'' or ``engaging in any
sexual activity''.<
Skermer's sentence comes just three months after the school's headmaster
Terence Vardon, 50, was fined #4,000 for keeping child pornography at his home
in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.<
The head resigned from his position at the school telling police he found the
naked bodies of young boys ``beautiful''.<
Andrew Lockhart, prosecuting, had told the court Skermer also thought young
boys ``looked graceful'' when they were naked.<
Skermer told arresting police officers he was not a homosexual, but admitted
to being a naturist, the court heard.<
Mr Lockhart said Skermer, who was head of Year Seven at the #4,500-a-year
school, had also taken pictures of a boy on a beach in Wales and two youngsters
fishing beside the River Welland in Northamptonshire in the late 1980s.<
Skermer, who last month admitted four charges of taking indecent photographs
and five charges of possessing them, committed the offences between 1980 and
April this year.<
The court was told Skermer, formally of Allersley Road, Coventry, had visited
Northamptonshire in 1988 and struck up conversation with two boys angling beside
a river, persuading them to take off their shorts and pose for 36 indecent
photographs while holding their fishing rods in an indecent fashion.<
The grey-haired teacher who resigned from his post in May admitted covertly
taking and possessing pictures of a youngster on a nudist beach in Wales.<
Other offences were committed at a Coventry rugby ground and at a swimming
pool in the city where Skermer encouraged three young boys to change into thongs
before taking indecent images using an underwater camera.<
Lawrence Watts, defending, said Skermer accepted his behaviour was wrong and
was thoroughly ashamed of what he had done.<
The defendant's 80-year-old mother had been hounded out of her Coventry home
and forced to move away from the area and Skermer had tried in vain to commit
suicide while awaiting court proceedings, Mr Watts said.<
Ordering Skermer to register as a sex offender for seven years and pay #500 to
prosecution costs, Judge Cole said he accepted the defence claims that the
disgraced teacher had last taken an indecent picture nine years ago.<
The defendant was a teacher at the Coventry school for almost 29 years.<
The haul of pictures was ordered to be destroyed.<
