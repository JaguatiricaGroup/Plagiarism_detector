SEVEN YEARS FOR WOMAN WHO TORTURED TEENAGE HUSBAND<
By Ashley Broadley, PA News<
A 35-year-old mother-of-four was today jailed for seven years for subjecting
her teenage husband to a nine-month regime of torture and abuse.<
Ryan Winstanley, who is now 20, was so unrecognisable after the attacks that
his mother did not realise it was him and thought he was ``a vagrant who had
come off the streets''.<
His wife Dawn had forced him to scald his own genitals, threw scalding water
over him from a kettle and beat him with a stick and umbrella.<
Winstanley, formerly of Russell Street, Eastwood, Rotherham, South Yorkshire,
was found guilty in May at Sheffield Crown Court of two counts of grievous
bodily harm and three counts of actual bodily harm.<
Passing sentence at Hull Crown Court today, Judge Jacqueline Davies said
Winstanley had carried out ``wicked offences'' and was a dangerous woman who
represented a high risk to the public.<
Mr Winstanley met his wife at the Zone Nightclub in Rotherham and after a
whirlwind romance, married her in June 1997.<
The jury was told that Winstanley, who has three children from another
marriage, became pregnant and had a baby boy in March 1998.<
Mr Winstanley - who has been scarred for life with 20% burns - had described
the relationship as brilliant and admitted to the jury that he was besotted with
his wife.<
But the jury was told that Winstanley soon began to control and manipulate her
husband.<
Judge Davies said Winstanley carried out nine months of ``cruel violence''
between January and September 1998.<
She said: ``You burned him with your electric curling tongs and on another
occasion pulled his mouth so hard it caused ulcerations. The violence increased
with the passage of time.<
``The jury heard that you poured boiling water over his shoulder, but he could
not move because he was bathing your baby.<
''You forbade him to look at other people in the street or even on television.
You made regulations about the way he had to walk and how he had to get out of
the car.<
``His own mother did not realise it was her son and mistook him for a vagrant
that had come off the streets.<
``These were wicked offences and I do not understand the reason why you
committed them.<
``There is no suggestion that he hurt you. You showed not a flicker of emotion
during the trial and no remorse now.<
''I can only conclude that you are a dangerous woman and represent a high risk
to the public.''<
Judge Davies sentenced Winstanley to a total of seven years.<
Winstanley smirked as she was led away from the dock.<
Afterwards Mr Winstanley's mother Karen said she was disappointed with the
sentence and had hoped for about 10 years.<
She urged other victims of domestic violence to get in touch with the police
before it was too late.<
She said: ``Anyone, male or female, must not be afraid to come forward. I
would like to encourage anyone who is suffering from domestic violence to seek
help.''<
