`YOU'LL THANK GOD' FORMER ANOREXIC TELLS TRANSPLANT GIRL<
By Chris Marritt, PA News<
A girl who was ordered to have life-saving treatment in a landmark case at the
High Court two years ago today told the teenager forced to have a heart
transplant: ``One day you'll thank God they didn't listen to you.''<
As the 15-year-old recovered from a transplant in Newcastle hospital after a
judge made her have the operation, former anorexic Chaye Parker said she would
one day be glad of the court's decision.<
Miss Parker, now 18, was 16 when the High Court in London decided that she
should be detained at a clinic - with force if necessary - when she continually
resisted treatment.<
At the time, she was a patient at Rhodes Farm clinic in Mill Hill, North
London, and resented the legal decision bitterly, but today she spoke publicly
for the first time.<
She told the Evening Standard in London: ``She'll be happy she was given the
chance. There's a big world out there and life is great. I feel sorry for her, I
understand completely how she feels.<
``It's her decision to make, but I also know she'll change her mind.<
``You feel you're mature enough to make that decision but you're not. I'm very
glad they didn't listen to a word I said. There is no way I would have survived
if they had.<
``You feel that because you're a child you are not allowed to have any rights
and that if you were an adult, they wouldn't be able to force you into
treatment. I just found that whole idea unbearable at the time, which is why I
kept running away.''<
The 1997 decision was the first of five such orders which sent Miss Parker
back to clinics from which she continually absconded despite the eating disorder
that was pushing her close to death.<
At her lowest point, Miss Parker's weight dropped to only five-and-a-half
stone. She even threatened to commit suicide and needed to be restrained from
throwing herself off a balcony.<
``At one point I just didn't care. I was determined it was my life, it was up
to me and I didn't want everyone to have power over me. That's why, when I read
about this girl, I just felt I had to speak out and tell that life is worth
living.<
``When you're ill though, your thought processes are impaired. Then you get a
bit older and you begin to see it's a wonderful world out there and you wouldn't
want to have missed it.''<
Now her weight is back up to a healthy level, Miss Parker, from Stoke
Newington, is intent on catching up on her education and going on to study
forensic science at university.<
Her case was the first time a judge had decided that not only did he have the
power to order her to have treatment - that had been done with anorexic children
before - but he could also order her detention under common law.<
The court heard that Miss Parker had begun worrying about her weight when she
was only 12, and had been suffering from anorexia for two years.<
When she was admitted to hospital in November 1996, it was found that she had
only eaten a few slices of cucumber in 10 days.<
By that time, she had a history of absconding from clinics trying to treat her
and although she had consented to undergo treatment, the clinics feared she
might withdraw her consent at any time.<
The local authority where she lived then took the case to court so that in the
event that Miss Parker changed her mind, which she subsequently did, there was a
court order in place forcing her to return.<
Yesterday's heart-transplant teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons,
said that she did not want to be different, and having somebody else's heart and
needing to take pills all her life would make her different.<
  The British Medical Association said the legal and ethical position
surrounding such cases was ``complicated and confused''.<
Dr Vivienne Nathanson, its head of health policy and research, said:
``Medically, consent to treatment and refusal of treatment are two sides of the
same coin and no doctor may override the wishes of a competent adult patient,
even if their decision seems extraordinary.<
``Legally, a young person of sufficient maturity may give consent to a
treatment but any refusal of treatment may be overridden by either their parents
or the courts.''<
