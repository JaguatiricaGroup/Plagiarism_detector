APPEAL JUDGES FREE VAGRANT JAILED FOR DOUBLE MURDER<
By Cathy Gordon, PA News<
A woman jailed for life 10 years ago for a double murder was freed today by
the Court of Appeal.<
Three judges in London ruled that the convictions of alcoholic vagrant Mary
Druhan, now in her 50s, were ``unsafe''.<
Several people in the courtroom wept as Lord Bingham, the Lord Chief Justice,
sitting with Mr Justice Alliott and Mrs Justice Steel announced the decision.<
Druhan had appealed against her conviction at Reading Crown Court in June 1989
for murdering Richard Duddie and Kenneth Challenger, who died in a fire at a
squat in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey.<
She consistently denied being present at the house.<
Druhan's first appeal failed in 1990.<
Her case featured in a Trial and Error television investigation six years ago
and was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review
Commission, which inquires into possible miscarriages of justice.<
