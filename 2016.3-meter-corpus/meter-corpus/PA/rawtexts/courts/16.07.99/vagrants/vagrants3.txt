                14:09 16/07/99: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Vagrants
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lord Bingham said that on the evidence as it now stood, the trial jury would
have been bound to conclude that however strong the grounds for suspicion,
``proof was lacking''.<
Druhan, who had been sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment to run
concurrently, sat in the dock today dressed in a smart blouse and jacket to hear
the court's decision.<
During the earlier appeal hearing the court heard that she was convicted
partly on the ``inconsistent'' evidence of fellow vagrants living in an
alcoholic ``nether world''.<
There was no scientific evidence against her.<
Lady Kennedy said that two witnesses who pointed the finger at Druhan as the
person responsible for starting the fire, were, like her, part of a vagrant
community whose members were known for their volatile and unpredictable
behaviour.<
She referred to the ``slippery'' quality of the evidence given by people with
fragile and dysfunctional personalities.<
``Their consciousness of time is wholly unreliable. Days melt into days and a
sense of real time doesn't exist for them,'' she said.<
Lady Kennedy said that Druhan's accusers, Robert Smith and a man called Neary,
had given markedly different accounts of what happened.<
Neary was now dead. Smith, whose whereabouts were unknown, had subsequently
been linked to two other fires at derelict houses, in one of which a woman
died.<
Lady Kennedy called fresh evidence during the appeal about the past character
of a third witness whose testimony was relied on by the Crown at trial.<
Lord Bingham said today that the evidence of this third prosecution witness,
although given in good faith and without malice, was ``seriously exaggerated''.<
His evidence concerned Druhan's behaviour during a drunken scene at a pub
before the fire. Lord Bingham said his accounts of what transpired ``were by no
means consistent''.<
There was also a failure to disclose the details of this particular man's
criminal record for forgery and shoplifting, and his background involving drug
addiction, which Lord Bingham said had deprived the defence of an ``important
opportunity to undermine his credibility as a witness''.<
Lord Bingham said that by an ``unfortunate oversight'' this witness's criminal
record was not disclosed in the lists of convictions supplied to counsel for the
Crown at trial ``and not disclosed at all to the defence''.<
Had that been done the man's drug addiction and treatment would have come to
light.<
Members of Druhan's family said after the ruling that they were ``delighted
and in a state of shock''.<
Druhan had come to England from Ireland to work as a nurse in a private
hospital when she was a young woman.<
However, after her husband died, she had turned to drink and mixed mainly with
fellow drinkers, living rough or in squats.<
Evidence over the sequence of events on the night of the fire were disputed,
but she was convicted on June 12, 1989.<
Trial and Error featured her story, pointing to what it suggested were many
discrepancies in the case against her and staging a reconstruction of the
alleged murder.<
Lord Bingham said today that the prosecution case as it emerged at her trial
had certain strengths, but had faced what the Court of Appeal had found were 17
``inherent problems''.<
