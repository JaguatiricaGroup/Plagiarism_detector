Razia Karim, legal officer of Justice, the legal reform pressure group which
has been working on Druhan's case for seven years, said later: ``Justice is
delighted by the court's judgment; it is a great day for Mary and her family.<
``However, Mary Druhan's case, like so many cases before it, underlines how
non-disclosure of evidence is one of the key causes of miscarriages of justice.<
``Given that the new regime in the Criminal Investigations Procedure Act 1996
makes disclosure even less likely, the number of miscarriages of justice cases
is set to increase.''<
David Jessel, presenter of Trial and Error which featured Druhan in its first
programme in 1993, said the evidence against her was so unreliable she should
``not even have been brought to trial''.<
