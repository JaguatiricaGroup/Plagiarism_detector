A chief constable's daughter found guilty of assaulting two officers in her
father's force after drinking a litre of strong cider was due to be sentenced
today.<
Frances Whitehouse, 18, of Brunswick Square, Hove, East Sussex, was convicted
by a Brighton magistrate last month of two counts of assault and one of using
threatening or abusive words or behaviour.<
The court heard that Whitehouse, who denied all three charges, pushed and
cursed Pc Paul Ashman after he intervened in a row between her and her boyfriend
at Norfolk Square, Hove, on Bank Holiday Monday April 5.<
After being handcuffed, she was driven to Brighton police station, but on the
way lashed out at Pc Anthony Spalding with her foot _ injuring his neck.<
Under cross-questioning, her boyfriend, Lloyd Smith, told the court he and
Whitehouse had each drunk a litre of strong cider at a friend's home during the
evening.<
Mr Smith said Whitehouse had swung round after being approached by Pc Ashman
from behind as the couple argued in the street, but she had not used violence.<
Whitehouse declined to speak in her own defence during the one-day trial.<
After finding her guilty of all three counts, stipendiary magistrate James
Shrimpton warned her he was considering all options for sentence.<
Granting Whitehouse unconditional bail, he adjourned the case until this
afternoon for pre-sentence reports.<
