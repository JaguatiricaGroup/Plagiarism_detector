          16:18 16/07/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Whitehouse Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
During Whitehouse's one-day trial, the court was told she assaulted Pc Paul
Ashman and swore at him after he approached and asked if she was all right while
she argued with her boyfriend in a Brighton street on Bank Holiday Monday, April
5.<
After being handcuffed, she was driven to Brighton police station but on the
way lashed out with her foot at Pc Anthony Spalding, who was driving, kicking
him on the left side of the face and neck.<
A medical examination a week later found that Pc Spalding had had his neck out
of joint, possibly as a result of the assault.<
Whitehouse's boyfriend, Lloyd Smith, told the court the pair had each drunk
four to five pints of White Lightning cider at a friend's home before the
incident, which happened as they made their way back to their own address at
about 9pm.<
He said Whitehouse had swung round in response to being approached by Pc
Ashman from behind, but had not used violence.<
Cross questioning, John Baggs, defending, challenged Pc Ashman and asked if he
had not been too quick to arrest Whitehouse without first warning her.<
Pc Ashman said: ``I felt threatened for my safety and had no choice.''<
Mr Baggs also referred to a police disciplinary hearing at which Pc Ashman had
admitted discreditable conduct after aiming a kick at a prisoner struggling on
the ground during a previous incident.<
When asked if he was usually aggressive when dealing with disturbances, Pc
Ashman replied ``No''.<
Whitehouse declined to give any evidence herself during the trial.<
In mitigation today, Mr Baggs told the court Whitehouse had been struggling to
get on her feet after suffering for years with a debilitating disease, and back
problems, which had caused her to miss large amounts of school time.<
She had finally left with four GCSE passes and was hoping to complete a
24-week course at a Hove college in an effort to improve her job prospects.<
Mr Baggs said Whitehouse was deeply remorseful for her actions and was
unlikely ever to commit an offence again.<
She had already suffered punishment because of the extensive media coverage of
her case, including one report in which ``lurid terms'' described her as one of
the offspring of people in high places who ``make their parents cringe''.<
Mr Shrimpton praised a statement received from Whitehouse's father, which
emphasised her regret, saying: ``The points made are written entirely as a
father, as it should be, and not as a result of his occupation.''<
But he added that Whitehouse could have avoided so much media attention if she
had pleaded guilty at the outset.<
He said: ``She, of course, cannot escape the fact that if you are a chief
constable's daughter you will get greater media attention.''<
Whitehouse was sentenced to 60 hours' community service in relation to Pc
Ashman and 150 hours in relation to Pc Spalding, to run concurrently. She was
ordered to pay #400 compensation to Pc Spalding and #250 costs, by July 30.<
After the 30-minute hearing, Whitehouse and her father left arm in arm but
declined to comment on the outcome.<
 Whitehouse's mother, Elizabeth, who left separately, also declined to
comment.<
