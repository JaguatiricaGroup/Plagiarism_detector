NURSE GETS #157,000 DAMAGES OVER STERILISER ASTHMA<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
A theatre nurse was today awarded #157,000 damages after the chemical she used
to sterilise instruments caused her to develop asthma.<
Fostina Brobbey, 58, welcomed the ruling by Judge Holman at Manchester County
Court but said she would prefer to be able to go back to work doing the job she
loved for more than 25 years.<
Mrs Brobbey, a mother of five, developed occupational asthma in 1995 after
coming into contact with the chemical C Sidex, a potent disinfectant used in
hospitals up and down the country which is known to cause breathing difficulties
and skin irritations if not used in the correct manner.<
