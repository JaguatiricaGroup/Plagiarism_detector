                 11:23 17/04/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Asthma
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mrs Brobbey was working at North Manchester General Hospital when she developed
asthma in 1995. In the September of 1996 she was forced to retire due to ill
health.<
The hospital's NHS Trust contested her claim for damages for personal injury
and losses, and was ordered to pay the compensation and significant costs after
a four-day court battle.<
Outside the county court Mrs Brobbey, from Manchester, said: ``I am pleased
with the ruling but I really didn't want to give up work. I would go back
tomorrow if I could.''<
She said that at first she did not realise what was causing the attacks but
then linked them to the chemical, which contains glutaraldehyde, when the asthma
eased off at home but returned when she cleaned equipment.<
``I would start to feel better, then when I went back to work, it would start
again,'' she said. <
``I couldn't do any dusting and lots of things irritate it now.<
``I have to carry inhalers with me all the time and the worst thing about it
is that some days it's fine then others I am bad.<
``I cannot really plan to do things that I want to do because I never know
when I'm going to have an asthma attack.''<
Hugh Robertson, head of health and safety for Unison, which backed the claim,
said: ``Another nurse lost to the NHS and many years of valuable experience
wasted, all because of needless exposure to dangerous chemicals.<
``There is no safe level of exposure to glutaraldehyde and no place for it in
hospitals today. It is well known that it can irritate the skin, eyes, throat
and lungs. <
``In very rare circumstances where it has to be used it should be in sealed
containers to protect hospital workers. I hope this case forces NHS trusts to
look again at the use of dangerous chemicals in hospitals.''<
Mrs Brobbey's award is one of the largest ever for asthma and included damages
for pain and suffering, past and future loss of earnings, loss of pension and
loss of congenial employment because she loved her job so much.<
Her solicitor Judith Gledhill said the NHS Trust had contested the claim
throughout and that it had been quite a battle in court.<
This was not the first case for damages for occupational asthma brought on by
the chemical, and there were similar claims in the pipeline, she added.<
