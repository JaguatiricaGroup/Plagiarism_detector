IT WAS SELF-DEFENCE, MURDER CASE JURY TOLD<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
A jury is tomorrow expected to start considering its verdict in the trial of a
farmer accused of murdering a teenaged burglar who broke into his isolated home
late at night.<
Tony Martin, 55, of Bleak House, Emneth Hungate, near Emneth, Norfolk, denies
murdering 16-year-old Fred Barras, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, and denies
attempting to murder a second burglar, Brendan Fearon, 30, also of Newark.<
He also denies wounding Fearon with intent to commit grievous bodily harm, and
denies possessing a Winchester 12-bore pump-action shotgun with intent to
endanger life.<
Martin admits possessing a shotgun without a certificate.<
Miss Rosamund Horwood-Smart QC, prosecuting, has told a jury of six men and
six women at Norwich Crown Court that Martin lay in wait for the burglars and
shot them ``like rats in a trap''.<
She told the jury today: ``This was a man who was prepared to be his own
police force, investigating force, jury, judge and if necessary executioner.<
``We say he was a man who was waiting for intruders ... This was not a blind
shooting.''<
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, defending, said Martin was a victim of crime who was
acting in self-defence.<
``Self-defence is a defence to all these charges,'' said Mr Scrivener. ``That
is our case here.<
``Mr Martin is a victim of crime. He didn't want people to burgle his house.
He was in a situation where he had to make some desperate decisions.<
``I hope you never have to make such decisions in your life. The wrong
decision on his part could lead him to suffer serious injury or even death.''<
The hearing continues tomorrow.<
