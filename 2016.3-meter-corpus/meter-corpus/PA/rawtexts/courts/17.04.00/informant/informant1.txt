`SUPERGRASS' LOSES #33,000 REWARD CLAIM<
By Mike Taylor, PA News<
Disgruntled ``supergrasses'' who claim they have been short-changed in rewards
paid for information supplied have no legal right to sue, a High Court judge
ruled today.<
The judgment came in a case launched by informant Keith Robinson who claimed
#33,574 plus interest against the Commissioners of Customs and Excise for breach
of an alleged contract under which he said he was promised reasonable
remuneration and expenses.<
Mr Justice Douglas Brown held that no contract existed and that in any event,
on grounds of public policy, ``an informant cannot maintain a claim against the
Commissioners or indeed a Chief Officer of Police in respect of any reward for
information supplied''.<
Mr Robinson, who ran a vehicle repair business in Leighton Buzzard, Beds,
alleged his Customs ``minders'' had promised he would be ``handsomely'' rewarded
after he agreed to the fitting of a tracking device in a Mercedes van stored at
his premises by drug smugglers.<
In the event, he received a total of #9,150 for information which led, among
other things, to the jailing of a drug smuggler for 10 years.<
Mr Robinson complained that he had been promised #10,000 for the drugs bust
alone and that he was owed far more for the help he gave in relation to an
insurance fraud and other drugs offences.<
The judge, who described Mr Robinson as ``a highly unreliable witness'', held
he had not been promised ``handsome'' rewards or promised any specific sums.
There was no contract or any intention to create ``legal relations''.<
He was sure that Mr Robinson was told he could not receive a wage as an
informant and that he would only be paid through the reward system operated by
Customs.<
To allow an informant to sue would involve the court in an examination of
sensitive matters and the ``unthinkable'' disclosure of information, normally
subject to public interest immunity, in the presence of a claimant ``who was
either a criminal or on the fringes of crime''.<
Unscrupulous informants - not including Mr Robinson, the judge stressed -
might bring claims with little or no merit with the object of forcing the
authorities to settle rather than reveal sources of information or operational
intelligence.<
The judge granted the Customs and Excise an order blocking Mr Robinson's claim
on the ground that he had no reasonable prospect of success.<
