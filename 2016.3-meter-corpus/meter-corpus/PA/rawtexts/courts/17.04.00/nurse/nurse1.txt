`I WOKE TO FIND NURSE RAPING ME,' WOMAN PATIENT TELLS COURT<
By Shenai Raif, PA News<
A woman broke down today as she told a court how she woke up in hospital and
saw a male nurse having sex with her.<
The 33-year-old sobbed as she recalled seeing 38-year-old Kevin Cobb was naked
from the waist down.<
She told the Old Bailey she blacked out after being given an injection and
found she was unable to move.<
``I had no sensation of any kind in my body. I could not move my limbs, I
could not move.<
``I could see what was happening but I could not feel it. I could not at that
point speak.<
``He looked rather shocked to see me looking at him but he still carried
on.''<
The woman said the incident happened when she was taken to the Accident and
Emergency department of St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, on January 12,
last year, suffering from severe abdominal pains.<
Cobb, of Yateley, Hampshire, who worked in the A&E of St Peter's and who is
married to a GP, is accused of drugging women with an anaesthetic in order to
rape or sexually assault them.<
He has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges including rape, administering the drug
Midazolam and the manslaughter of junior sister Susan Annis, 31, who died at a
nurses's home when her body reacted adversely to the drug.<
The Old Bailey was told that the 33-year-old woman blacked out again after
realising she was being assaulted and came to later as Cobb had his back to
her.<
She said to him: `What were you doing to me? Why were you having sex with
me?'<
The woman told the court: ``He turned round and kind of shrugged his shoulders
and said `Oh you remember that do you? Well, don't worry, you won't remember
that later'.<
``When he said those words, I thought `Yes, I will remember it'. He left the
room and I felt a sense of relief. I was frightened and upset.''<
She said she told her boyfriend, who called Cobb back and challenged him. But
the nurse denied giving her drugs and claimed she had fainted.<
Asked by the woman why he had been touching her, Cobb allegedly said: ``I was
only having a bit of a feel. I am not allowed to do anything else.''<
