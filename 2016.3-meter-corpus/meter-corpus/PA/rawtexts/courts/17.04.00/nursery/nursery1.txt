NURSERY OWNER `TIED CHILD TO A CHAIR', COURT TOLD<
By Cathy Coleman, PA News<
The owner of a children's nursery tied a three-year-old child to a chair with
a scarf because he would not sit down and force fed other children until they
were physically sick, a court was told today.<
Margaret Gloria Price, 58, who did not have any child care qualifications or
training when she started the Playtime nursery in Bell Lane, Brecon, south
Wales, pleaded not guilty to 14 charges of child cruelty at Merthyr Crown
Court.<
It is alleged that Price, who is the wife of a solicitor in the town, was
cruel towards several children, some as young as 12 months, in her care between
November 1995 and March 1999.<
The court heard that Price is also alleged to have hit a young boy over the
back of the head with a hard book because he would not listen to a story she was
reading and forced a little girl to bite her own hand.<
The jury, of seven men and five women, were told that the girl was placed in a
high chair and her hand was put into her mouth at which point it is alleged
Price forced the little girl's chin up while saying: `This will teach you what
it feels like.'<
In another incident, it is alleged she told a three-year-old boy `You are like
a fat, lazy pudding that doesn't taste very nice'' because he could not say his
alphabet.<
It is also alleged she would not let staff help a young girl in distress who
had slipped down from her high chair and caught her chin on the table.<
The court heard staff said it was two minutes before she would let anyone help
the young girl, who was crying and obviously in distress.<
David Aubrey QC, prosecuting, told the court: ``The initial facilities (at the
nursery) were regarded as good. But the reality altered as time went by.<
``We are talking about the deliberated, criminal ill-treatment of these
children.''<
He added that staff who worked for her had described her as a ``tyrant'', a
``bully'' and said that she had created a ``culture of fear in the nursery''.<
And he said that Price had targeted particular children because she disliked
their parents.<
The case, which was adjourned until tomorrow, is expected to last up to four
weeks.<
