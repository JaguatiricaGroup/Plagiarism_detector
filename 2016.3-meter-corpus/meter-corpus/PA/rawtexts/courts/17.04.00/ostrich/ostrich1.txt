OSTRICH FARM WOMAN GETS SUSPENDED SENTENCE<
By Michael Bristow, PA News<
A businesswoman was today given a two-year suspended jail sentence after being
convicted of stealing nearly #300,000 from investors who poured money into her
ostrich farm.<
Esther Evans, 36, was also banned from being involved in a company for 10
years after being found guilty of four charges of theft and one count of
fraudulent trading.<
Judge Michael Burr told Swansea Crown Court that the ostrich farm, set up in
Dunvant, near Swansea, in 1995 was a dishonest scheme to get money from
investors.<
He said: ``I am satisfied that the whole ostrich farm was set up from the
beginning as a dishonest means of depriving investors of their money.''<
He told Evans, of Uplands, Swansea, that she was ``not the innocent dupe you
invited the jury to accept you were'', but added that she had been manipulated
by her husband Martin.<
Martin Evans, 38, was due to stand trial with Esther Evans on similar charges,
but did not turn up for the start of the hearing, and has not been seen since.<
