  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the two-week trial the court heard that Esther and Martin Evans set up
the ostrich-breeding farm in November, 1995 after Martin Evans was released from
prison following a sentence for obtaining property by deception.<
The couple placed adverts in national newspapers under the slogan of Ostrich
Nest Egg and produced a brochure for potential investors at a time when the
public were concerned about the safety of beef.<
Investors believed their money would be used to buy and look after ostriches,
which would be bred to produce other birds.<
The second generation would then be sold off for meat. <
The court heard that 115 people invested a total of about #875,000 in the farm
before the business was declared insolvent in July, 1996.<
Much of the money paid into the company by investors was taken out and
transferred to other bank accounts, including one in the Bahamas.<
Esther Evans was found guilty of stealing a total of #275,500.<
She was cleared of three further charges of stealing a total of about
#55,000.<
Mr Christopher Llewellyn Jones, prosecuting, said: ``The couple, who had
absolutely no experience in farming let alone ostrich farming, saw the
opportunity to commit large-scale fraud.''<
Esther Evans told the court that although she was a director and company
secretary of the business she knew nothing of what was going on and only did
what her husband told her to do.<
The mother-of-three said: ``In one sense he was pulling the wool over my eyes.
I have done nothing wrong in this.''<
The judge accepted that Esther Evans had carried out a ``subservient and
menial'' role compared to her husband, who was once named Businessman of the
Year in Wales.<
Probation officer Michael Reynolds told the court today that he considered
that Martin Evans ``appeared to tainted with evil'' and had used his wife as a
``tool'' in the ostrich farm scam.<
During the hearing the court also heard how Martin Evans loved the ``high
life'' and had run a string of businesses in the past, including a hairdressing
salon, a video shop and a bar in Spain.<
