SWORD MURDER CHARGE MAN APPEARS IN COURT<
By Dave Higgens, PA News<
A man accused of stabbing a Liberal Democrat party worker to death with a
Samurai sword and attempting to kill an MP made his first appearance before a
judge today.<
Drainage engineer Rob Ashman, 49, is accused of murdering 39-year-old
Gloucestershire County Councillor Andy Pennington and attempting to murder
Liberal Democrat Cheltenham MP Nigel Jones.<
The attack is alleged to have taken place in Mr Jones' constituency office in
Cheltenham on Friday January 28.<
Ashman, of Lansdown Close, Cheltenham, spoke just once, to confirm his name,
during the 25 minute hearing at Bristol Crown Court.<
The judge, Mrs Justice Hallett, refused an application by Anne Mallalieu QC,
defending, to re-impose reporting restrictions, which were lifted at the
defendant's request at a committal hearing in Cheltenham earlier this year.<
She also indicated she was sympathetic to the defence's application to
transfer the case to Exeter Crown Court, but said she could not make a firm
decision until she knew whether a judge would be available there to try the
case.<
Baroness Mallalieu said the case should be transferred because Mr Jones was a
prominent figure in the Bristol area and would be a key witness in the case.<
Ashman was also involved in disputes with a number of lawyers in the Bristol
area which might be referred to in the proceedings, she added.<
The judge ordered another hearing to take place at a date to be fixed in
July.<
Ashman, who was wearing a grey suit, white shirt and red tie, took notes as he
sat in the dock flanked by three prison officers.<
He was remanded in custody.<
