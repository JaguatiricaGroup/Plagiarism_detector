TV RESEARCHER GETS LIBEL DAMAGES OVER `VANESSA' STORY<
By Cathy Gordon, PA News<
A television researcher accused of arranging for fake guests to appear on the
BBC's Vanessa show today accepted ``large'' libel damages in the High Court.<
Deborah Price, 25, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, who is now a
researcher on Cilla Black's Blind Date, also received a public apology over an
article published in The Mirror in February last year concerning the show hosted
by Vanessa Feltz.<
Ms Price's solicitor-advocate, David Price, told Mr Justice Eady in London
that the article ``disclosed that several guests who had appeared on the show
purporting to relate true-life stories were in fact fakes who had invented the
accounts which they presented to viewers''.<
One item featured a woman who alleged that she wanted a divorce when, in fact,
she was not married, he said.<
``Another concerned two women who claimed they were sisters, but were in fact,
unrelated.''<
Ms Price was the researcher who had arranged for the guests to appear on the
show, he said.<
``The article went on to allege that not only were the guests fakes, but that
Ms Price had known that they were fakes and had thereby deliberately deceived
her employers and the viewers of the show.''<
But the truth of the matter was that Miss Price neither knew nor suspected
that any of the guests were faked _ she took reasonable steps to verify their
authenticity, ``bearing in mind the time constraints imposed on her by her
employers, the BBC'', Mr Price said.<
He added: ``The three faked guests all admitted that they had sought to
deceive Ms Price into believing that they were genuine and stated that they had
no reason to believe that Ms Price was aware that they were fakes.''<
Ms Price was ``devastated'' by the article.<
The defendant, MGN Ltd, publisher of The Mirror, now accepted that there was
no truth in the allegation that Ms Price knew that the guests were fakes.<
The judge was told that Ms Price, who also received her legal costs, hoped she
could now pursue a career in television production ``without a stain on her
reputation''.<
