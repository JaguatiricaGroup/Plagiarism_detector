CARE WORKERS JAILED FOR CHILD SEX ABUSE<
By Michael Bristow, PA News<
Two key workers at a children's home were today sentenced to a total of 23
years in prison for a string of sexual assaults on boys in their care.<
Former Deputy Principal Barrie Alden, 66, from Norwich, was given a total of
15 years in jail after being convicted of 10 charges which included committing
serious sexual assaults.<
Ex-house master John Wright, 56, from Talgarth, Powys, was sentenced a total
of eight years after being found guilty of six charges including indecent
assaults on boys. <
The pair, who denied the charges against them, were found not guilty of other
offences after a six-week trial at Newport Crown Court, in South Wales. <
Judge Thomas Crowther QC said: ``Your behaviour showed a pattern of showing
favour and care and then to abuse that trust. It's regrettably a common
feature.<
``You then misused your power to attempt to gratify your sexual urges upon
them (the boys).''<
Alden and Wright committed the offences on a total of eight boys at the Ty
Mawr residential home, near Abergavenny, South Wales, from the 1960s to the
1980s. The council-run institution for vulnerable children was closed in 1991.<
Prosecutor Roger Thomas QC told the court the defendants had satisfied their
sexual desires on the boys, many of whom came from broken homes.<
Alden and Wright claimed the boys were lying, had colluded or were attempting
to gain compensation.<
The pair were arrested as part of Operation Flight, a police investigation
into abuse at children's homes in Gwent.<
  Alden, who faced a total of 18 charges, was found guilty of five indecent
assaults, four serious sexual assaults and one gross indecency. He was found not
guilty of five serious sexual assaults, two indecent assaults and one other
assault.<
Wright, who faced 13 charges, was convicted of four indecent assaults and two
charges of attempting to carry out a serious sexual assault. He was found not
guilty of three indecent assaults, three serious sexual assaults and one charge
of indecency with a child.<
The Judge ordered that both men would have to register as sex offenders
``indefinitely'' after their release from prison.<
After the men were found guilty yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector Terry
Hapgood, the senior officer involved in Operation Flight, said: ``It has been a
long and intricate task to bring these people to justice but it underlines the
determination of the team that all allegations of this nature are thoroughly and
rigorously investigated.''<
