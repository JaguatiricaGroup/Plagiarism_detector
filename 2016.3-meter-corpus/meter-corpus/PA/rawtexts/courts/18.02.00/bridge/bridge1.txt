JURY OUT IN BRIDGE DEATH CASE<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
A jury was today continuing its deliberations in the case of four youths
charged with the murder of a ``promising'' A-level student who drowned in a
river after being robbed and kidnapped outside a night club.<
The body of 18-year-old Jonathan Coles was recovered from the River Ouse five
days after he was allegedly murdered following a confrontation outside a club in
Milton Keynes on June 11 last year.<
Brian Alleyne, 19 and Dwayne Dawkins, 20, both of North Seventh Street, Milton
Keynes, Jason Canepe, 20, of Great Denton, Eaglestone, Milton Keynes, and a
17-year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons are standing trial for the
murder as well as facing charges of kidnap and robbery.<
Canepe was cleared during the trial of the charge of robbery and has admitted
kidnapping and manslaughter, charges to which Dawkins, who denies robbery, has
also pleaded guilty.<
Alleyne and the 17-year-old have pleaded not guilty to kidnap and robbery,
while all four deny murder.<
William Coker QC, prosecuting, has alleged that the four captured Jonathan, of
Wendover, near Aylesbury, Bucks, after he became involved in a seemingly
unprovoked dispute with a friend of theirs.<
They forced him to hand over his wallet, containing his bank card, and his pin
number, and drove to a cashpoint where they tried to withdraw money from his
bank account, but when it became clear the account was empty they returned to
Jonathan, Mr Coker said.<
Jonathan was then driven in Canepe's car to Tyringham Bridge, a popular
fishing spot near Newport Pagnell, Bucks, where he was pushed into the water
25-feet below and drowned, Mr Coker went on.<
Jonathan, who attended Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School in Aylesbury, was
described as ``a confident, outgoing young man with an active social life.''<
He had spent the evening celebrating a friend's 18th birthday at The Empire
night club, in Milton Keynes, and had three more A-level exams to sit when he
died.<
Judge Geoffrey Rivlin directed the jury to return unanimous verdicts on all
four defendants and told them that the court would take the unusual step of
sitting tomorrow if they were unable to return a verdict today.<
