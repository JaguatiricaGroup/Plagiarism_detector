Judge Geoffrey Rivlin adjourned sentencing on the four, who also faced charges
of kidnapping and robbery, for pre-sentence reports.<
He said: ``This is plainly a case in which pre-sentence reports must be called
for having regard to the ages and circumstances of the defendants.''<
Canepe was cleared of robbery during the trial, but pleaded guilty to
kidnapping, a charge which Dawkins, who was convicted of robbery, also
admitted.<
Dawkins, like Canepe, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but was convicted by the
jury of murder.<
Alleyne and Matthews pleaded not guilty to all three charges of robbery,
kidnapping and murder, but were convicted on all counts.<
None of the defendants showed any emotion as the verdicts were returned by the
foreman.<
There were gasps from the public gallery as Canepe was cleared of murder, but
the sound turned to one of muffled sobbing as Dawkins, Alleyne and Matthews were
convicted in turn.<
Some of Jonathan's family and friends, who had sat in court throughout the
three week long trial, burst into tears of relief and hugged each other at the
end of the proceedings.<
