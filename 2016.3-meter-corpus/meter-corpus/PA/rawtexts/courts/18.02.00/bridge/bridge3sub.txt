Jonathan Coles had taken a night off from studying for his A levels at Sir Henry
Floyd Grammar School, in Aylesbury, to celebrate a friend's 18th birthday at a
Milton Keynes night club when he became involved in the violence which led to
his death.<
The court heard that the murder was the final act in a ``downward spiral'' of
``mindless violence'' during which, Canepe later admitted, ``we lost our sense
of human pity''.<
Jonathan, from Wendover, near Aylesbury, knew nothing of his killers until he
left the Empire night club, in central Milton Keynes, in the early hours of June
11 last year.<
He was with a group of friends and became embroiled in an argument with a
youth about a cigarette which quickly escalated into a face off with a group of
about ten youths.<
The teenager fled across a stretch of wasteland, but was separated from his
friends and caught by Alleyne and Dawkins, who were at the head of the chasing
pack.<
They were joined by Matthews and the three beat Jonathan savagely until he
gave up his bank card and pin number, but when they took the card to a cash
point machine they discovered Jonathan's account was empty.<
They returned to find Jonathan, who had lost his glasses in the beating,
blindly flagging down cars in a desperate attempt to get to a friend's house,
and bundled him into Canepe's car.<
After driving the terrified student around Milton Keynes for about half an
hour, they decided to take him to Tyringham Bridge, a popular fishing spot near
Newport Pagnell, where he was pushed into the water and drowned.<
Jonathan's father, Colin, made an emotional public appeal for the return of
his son, whom he last saw as he left for school on the morning of June 10.<
But the close-knit Coles family's fears were confirmed when Jonathan's body
was recovered from the river after being spotted by two fishermen on June 16.<
Blood matching the teenager's DNA was found on the backseat of Canepe's car
when it was recovered by police, while CCTV footage taken at a garage where
Canepe stopped to buy petrol clearly showed him in the back of the car
sandwiched between Matthews and Dawkins.<
Jonathan, a keen musician, had three A-level exams left to sit when he died.
He was described as ``a confident, outgoing young man with an active social
life'' and ``a promising future''.<
