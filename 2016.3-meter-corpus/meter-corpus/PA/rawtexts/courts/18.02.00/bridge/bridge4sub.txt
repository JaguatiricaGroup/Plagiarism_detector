            17:13 18/02/00: Page 4 (HHH) COURTS Bridge Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan's ordeal lasted approximately two hours from the moment when violence
flared outside the night club for the first time to the point when he was pushed
off the bridge.<
Canepe told the court he stayed at the wheel of his green Peugeot while the
other three dragged Jonathan to the centre of Tyringham Bridge, 25 foot above
the water which is 10 feet deep.<
According to Dawkins account, Jonathan pleaded that he could not swim, but he
was pushed over the edge fully clothed and with his shoes on.<
Marks on Jonathan's body indicated that he managed to cling on to the bridge
parapet as he fell, but his attackers beat his hands until he lost his grip and
plunged into the water.<
A post-mortem examination also showed that Jonathan had torn the muscles in
his back in the desperate struggle to stop himself falling.<
Dawkins told the court Alleyne and Matthews ran down to the bank, where they
saw Jonathan trying to swim towards what looked like a log. <
``I looked over and he started swimming. He looked like he was going to make
it, and he did get close,'' Dawkins said. <
``Brian and Darren went round the bank to see if they could help him, but he
looked like he wasn't going to make it, so Brian and Darren went back to the
car.''<
Canepe said he heard splashing sounds and Alleyne's voice shouting ``go on, go
on'', as Jonathan tried to swim.<
But, despite Matthews being a strong swimmer who knew the stretch of water
well, the three walked away from the scene, leaving Jonathan to drown. <
William Coker QC, prosecuting, pointed out to the jury that ``there was no
evidence that any of these defendants lifted a finger to help him.''<
