  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  By Dawkins and Canepe's accounts it was Alleyne, described by the prosecution
as having a ``calculating mind'', who was the ringleader of the operation, but
the other three were willing participants, with Canepe acting as the driver.<
At some point Alleyne managed to extract from Jonathan his telephone number
and that of his friend who lived at Rowsham Dell, which were still stored in the
memory of his mobile phone when he was seized by police.<
It was less clear what the motive was for the murder. Dawkins said he had
drunk about eight pints of lager that evening, but Canepe told the court he had
drunk nothing while Alleyne and Matthews said they had been drinking but felt
sober when they left the club.<
Mr Coker, in outlining the case to the jury, said events appeared to have
followed a ``downward spiral'' and suggested to them that ``these defendants
eventually decided it would be better for them if Jonathan was not able to tell
the tale of what had happened to him''.<
Canepe told the court that he and his companions had ``enjoyed'' taking
Jonathan hostage in his car and that even at the bridge ``the mood was one of
laughing and joking''.<
He said: ``It all followed - one thing led to another. One bad thing followed
by an even worse thing.<
''We gradually lost our sense of being civilised human beings and our feelings
of human pity.<
''We were prepared to do things to another human being that we would not have
dreamed that we were capable of.''<
Dawkins also admitted that the four had been in a ``vicious mood'' from the
moment that they realised Jonathan had duped them with his empty bank account.<
Nicholas Browne QC, who defended Dawkins, told the jury that ``for about an
hour, if not more, these four young men stepped out of the ambit of civilised
conduct.''<
Alleyne and Matthews, who denied any part in the killing, were less
forthcoming about the crime or its motives, denying throughout the trial that
they had even gone to Tyringham Bridge.<
There was little in the four's past history to suggest they were capable of
such a crime.<
Matthews, who still lived with his mother, worked as a waiter at the Beefeater
restaurant in Milton Keynes and had never met Canepe or Dawkins before the early
hours of June 11.<
Dawkins left school with nine GCSEs and had taken jobs on the shop floor in
local Netto and Waitrose supermarkets.<
Canepe, who knew Dawkins as a boy, had taken an NVQ in catering but his career
was cut short just a few weeks into his first job at a hotel when he injured his
hand and was laid off.<
He took another job as a delivery driver at Dairy Crest, but was sacked after
using one of the company's vans illegally, an offence for which he served a
community service order. His most recent job was as a dustman.<
Only Alleyne, a talented footballer who had played for Queen's Park Rangers
under 16 side, had a criminal career of any note, with convictions on five
counts of obtaining money by deception from December 1998.<
