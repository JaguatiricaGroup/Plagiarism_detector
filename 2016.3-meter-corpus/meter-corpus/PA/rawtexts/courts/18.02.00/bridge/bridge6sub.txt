Detective Inspector Trevor Howie, of Thames Valley Police said the sheer
mindlessness of the killing ``beggars belief''. <
He said: ``I think we are all very pleased that justice has been done today.<
``We are very mindful of the fact that the family have suffered for nine
months with this ordeal and we hope in some small way that this will help them
to come to terms with an appalling tragedy for them.<
``I think the circumstances of it touched everybody who worked for the police
and every other agency involved in it because it was simply so futile.<
``The motive is unclear even now, despite the fact that the verdicts have been
reached.<
``Maybe he was just a witness and they needed to get rid of him. If it wasn't
that I don't know what it was.''<
Jonathan's parents, Colin and Ursula Coles, who both work at Stoke Mandeville
Hospital in Aylesbury left the court without commenting on the outcome of the
case. <
