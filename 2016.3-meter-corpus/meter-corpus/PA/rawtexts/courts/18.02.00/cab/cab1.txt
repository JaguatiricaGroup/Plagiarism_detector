CABBIE JAILED FOR RAPING PASSENGER<
An unlicensed minicab driver was jailed for seven years at the Old Bailey
today for raping a passenger while she slept on the back seat.<
Kenneth Williamson, 44, from Holloway, north London attacked his victim as he
took her home after she spent a Friday night out at wine bars with friends.<
The woman, aged 28 - who admitted being drunk - had fallen asleep on the
journey. She woke, realised what had happened and attacked him physically.<
Williamson, a father of two, told her she had asked him to have sex with her.<
She went to police after demanding Williamson give her his personal details.
He passed her a school report to write them down.<
The details were all false, but police traced him through the report which had
been dropped by a friend of the family.<
When arrested Williamson told police he had had sex with about eight customers
in the year - some had been drinking but all had consented. He denied the rape -
in March last year - but was convicted by the jury.<
After the case, police made an appeal to any women who may have been the
victim of a sexual attack to come forward.<
The appeal comes a day after a Home Office study stating almost 300,000 women
may have been raped or sexually assaulted in Britain every year - more than 12
times the official police figures.<
Det Chief Insp Dick Brookes said however difficult it was, women should ``dig
deep into their reserves''. By helping police investigate and seeing the case
through the sometimes difficult court procedures, they could maximise the chance
of bringing their attackers to justice.<
Williamson's victim, described as well-educated, is still traumatised by the
attack. She was not in court to see him sentenced.<
