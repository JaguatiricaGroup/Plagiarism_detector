CAR CLOCKING SCAM RINGLEADER JAILED<
By Nick Allen, PA News<
The ringleader of a huge car clocking operation, which trading standards
investigators believe may have involved hundreds of vehicles, was today jailed
for 18 months and ordered to pay #20,000 costs.<
Andrew Hawkins, 42, who operated from Greenacres Farm, Winterbourne, South
Gloucestershire, had earlier pleaded guilty to 14 counts of applying false trade
descriptions.<
He was caught when a woman became worried about the handling of a Ford Sierra
she had bought from Gary King, 35, of Langmead Road, Paignton, Devon, who
regularly advertised in Auto Trader.<
Hayley Pearman took the car into a garage where she was told it was
unroadworthy and subsequently complained to Devon County Council's trading
standards department.<
Investigators were subsequently led to Hawkins and a third dealer Glyn Knight,
36, of Elmlea, Stockwood Vale, Keynsham, Bristol.<
Knight ran a large second hand car business in the centre of Bristol called St
George's Motor Company.<
Knight admitted six counts of applying false trade descriptions and King
admitted seven counts but both denied they knew the cars had been clocked by
Hawkins.<
Hawkins gave evidence that the pair told him what mileages they wanted on the
cars and Judge Michael Self decided they knew what was going on.<
Knight and King are due to be sentenced at a later date.<
Sentencing Hawkins the judge said he had been at the forefront of the
operation, clocking cars on a regular basis.<
He also ordered the forfeiture of two cars seized from Hawkins by trading
standards officers.<
Prosecutor Martin Meeke said: ``This has been revealed to be the biggest car
clocking operation in the UK.''<
Following the hearing Tony Lindsell, Devon's senior trading standards
investigator, said he believed hundreds of cars had been clocked over a three
year period.<
