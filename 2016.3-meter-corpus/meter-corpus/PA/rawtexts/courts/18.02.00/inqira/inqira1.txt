SHOT TERRORIST: INQUEST JURY CONSIDERS VERDICT<
By John Sheehan, PA News<
An inquest jury was today due to retire to consider its verdict in the case of
a suspected IRA terrorist shot dead during a police raid.<
Diarmuid O'Neill, 27, died when police raided a hotel in Hammersmith, west
London in September 1996.<
The jury sitting at Kingston upon Thames Crown Court will decide whether Mr
O'Neill was unlawfully killed when armed police burst into the room where he was
staying with two other suspected terrorists.<
During a three-week hearing they have heard how police made a ``catalogue of
errors'' when they shot dead unarmed O'Neill.<
He was gunned down amid ``chaotic'' scenes after the firearms team entered the
hotel and found they could not get into the suspects' room because their
duplicate key would not work.<
When officers used a battering ram to try to break down the door, the
implement simply crashed straight through, leaving a gaping hole. Officers were
also blinded by CS gas which had been sprayed into the room.<
The policeman who fired the fatal shots told the inquest he feared O'Neill was
holding a gun.<
Coroner Dr John Burton told the hearing that anti-terrorist police had
targeted O'Neill and his group following a number of explosions including one at
Canary Wharf in London and in Manchester city centre.<
He said it was up to the jury to decide whether the officers involved in the
operation had acted reasonably under the circumstances.<
O'Neill's parents Eoghan and Terry, from west Cork in the Irish Republic, have
been present throughout the hearing and were expected to attend the final day.<
