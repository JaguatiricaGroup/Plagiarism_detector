SHOTS IN ROOM 303 THAT KILLED IRA DANGER MAN<
By John Sheehan, PA News<
The jury at the inquest into the death of Diarmuid O'Neill heard three weeks
of evidence about the fatal raid.<
The attack was the culmination of a three month surveillance operation that
linked suspected IRA quartermaster O'Neill to six tons of explosives found in
London.<
Officers targeted O'Neill and his accomplices and broke into a storage depot
in north London where they discovered the home made explosives and three assault
rifles.<
Police feared the terrorist cell was preparing to detonate a huge lorry bomb
somewhere in central London.<
At the time, IRA active service units on the mainland had carried out a number
of attacks including bombings in Manchester, London Docklands and in the
Aldwych, central London.<
In a briefing before the raid, officers watched a video of the Docklands
bombing and heard a recording of an IRA suspect vowing to shoot officers who
tried to arrest him.<
The conversations between O'Neill and Patrick Kelly were recorded after a
bugging device was hidden in O'Neill's Volkswagen Jetta car.<
During the hearing, the officer who fired the shot which killed O'Neill, told
the jury he believed his life had been in danger.<
Officer Kilo, who gave evidence from behind a screen to protect his identity,
said he had opened fire because he feared O'Neill was holding a gun.<
He had told the jury that he had pushed open the door to room 303 of the
Glenthorne Road Hotel and seen a figure standing in front of him.<
He admitted his vision had been badly affected by 10 rounds of CS gas which
had been pumped into the room moments before he opened fire, but said he had no
choice but to shoot after the suspect failed to show his hands.<
Officer Kilo had told the hearing: ``His body language suggested he was
holding a weapon. He was bristling. This was a man who was going to kill me.<
``He was standing in a classic boxer stance. His hands were down. My
perception was he had a gun and I was going to die.''<
O'Neill, who was dressed only in his underpants, died in the room where no
weapons were found.<
Michael Mansfield QC, representing the victim's family, told the jury that
police had made a ``catalogue of errors'' when they shot O'Neill amid
``chaotic'' scenes at the hotel.<
The barrister said things began to go wrong after the firearms team entered
the hotel and found they could not get into the suspects' room because their
duplicate key would not work.<
When officers used a battering ram - called an enforcer - to try to break down
the door the implement simply crashed straight through leaving a gaping hole.<
Officers then decided to spray CS gas into the room through the hole and also
through a window, the inquest was told.<
As well as affecting those inside the room the gas incapacitated the majority
of the police officers who were forced to flee downstairs and out of the hotel.<
Mr Mansfield suggested some officers may have been less affected by the potent
gas had they not left their masks at home.<
He said that, according to the transcript, officers then made no warning
before shooting O'Neill dead.<
The inquest was told how, after the shooting, O'Neill then had to ``be
dragged'' from the building because the firearms team did not have a stretcher.<
