an inquest jury ruled today.<
Diarmuid O'Neill, 27, died when he was hit six times with shots from an
automatic rifle in a west London hotel room in September 1996.<
Armed police burst into the room after a three-month surveillance operation
had targeted O'Neill and his accomplices, who had amassed six tons of home-made
explosives in a London hideaway.<
A jury at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court took four hours to reach their
majority verdict.<
