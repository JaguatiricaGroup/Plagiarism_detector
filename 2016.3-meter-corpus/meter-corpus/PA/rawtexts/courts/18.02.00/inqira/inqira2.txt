The inquest jury later retired to consider its verdict.<
Dr Burton told the five men and five women that they must decide whether
O'Neill had been unlawfully killed, lawfully killed, or whether they could
return an open verdict. <
``You have three possible conclusions. `He was killed unlawfully', which can
be presented to say he was a martyr and it justifies what the campaign set out
to achieve.<
```He was killed lawfully', which can be presented to show that it is lawful
in England to kill people without trial and that justifies and explains the
conflict.<
``Or you have an open verdict and that can be presented however the person
seeks to use it.''<
