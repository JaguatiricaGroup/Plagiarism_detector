O'Neill's father, Eoghan, and mother, Terry, sat silently at the back of the
court as West London coroner Dr John Burton read out the verdict.<
Throughout the three-week hearing, Michael Mansfield QC, representing the
family, had cross-examined a string of police witnesses.<
Addressing the jury afterwards, Dr Burton said: ``There has been criticism of
my remarks to the jury. I have been here three weeks. I am not proud of my
conduct in this inquiry or the form of the inquiry itself.<
``Mr Mansfield has said that we live in a democratic society and that people
who volunteer to take risks must be prepared to answer for the consequences of
their acts.<
``He is right. This is a democratic society. That society has required the
police officers to take risks on our behalf. We ask them to do it.<
``I have subjected them to three-weeks' sustained attack without the
protection afforded by the criminal court, with no pretence of natural justice
and there is nothing that I can do about it.<
``The need to change the law to prevent this is to me overwhelming.''<
