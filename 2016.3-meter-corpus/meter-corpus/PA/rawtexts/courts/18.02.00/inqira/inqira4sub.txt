Speaking afterwards, O'Neill's father Eoghan said he was ``disappointed'' with
the verdict and was considering an appeal.<
He said: ``I am disappointed at the police. The police were deaf, blind and
dumb. They should never have gone in there with the gas. My son would still be
alive if they had not gone in with CS gas.<
``I'm disappointed with the verdict. We wanted justice. I think the police
have got away lightly. We will have to think about lodging an appeal which we
can do, and having a public inquiry.''<
In a statement read outside court Mr O'Neill added: ``We are very conscious
that nothing can bring our son back to life but all of this could happen again.<
``Our son is not the only unarmed person who has been shot by armed officers
in recent years in London.<
``The coroner asked before the inquest but was refused, that a public inquiry
be ordered by the Home Secretary as the issues raised were so difficult and
important.<
``Now that this inquest has finished and has uncovered decisions and actions
that the police clearly are content to repeat, we suggest that a different form
of public inquiry be held which can investigate all recent fatal shootings by
armed police in order to ensure that lessons are learned, whether or not the
police voluntarily agree.''<
