Outside the court Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of New Scotland
Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said: ``I would immediately wish to express on
behalf of the Metropolitan Police my regrets for the death of Diarmuid O'Neill.<
``The decision by the jury supports the actions by Officer Kilo and others who
were faced with dangerous terrorists who were planning to bomb London and had
access to explosives and firearms.''<
He said the operation was the longest and largest counter-terrorist
surveillance operation ever undertaken in England and Wales.<
``It lasted for six weeks, during the course of which police officers kept
those terrorist suspects under surveillance at no little risk to themselves for
the protection of the public.<
``During the course of the operation it was found these men had access to a
huge quantity of home-made explosives, 22lb of Semtex, sufficient to make three
lorry bombs of the type that caused the devastation at Canary Wharf and in the
shopping centre in the heart of Manchester.<
``It threatened to cause the deaths and injuries of innocent members of the
public going about their ordinary business and doing their shopping.''<
He added that the terrorist cell also had access to firearms including AK-47
assault rifles and enough ammunition to ``have killed and maimed scores of
people''.<
He said the men also had under-car booby traps at their disposal.<
Mr Fry said he had noted the comments of jurors who had called for
investigations into the use of CS gas and respiratory masks during armed raids.<
