EX-PALACE FOOTMAN SPARED PRISON AFTER LOVE TORMENT DEATH THREAT<
By Melvyn Howe and Sherna Noah, PA News<
A former Buckingham Palace footman was spared a prison sentence today after
admitting threatening to kill a much younger ``Below Stairs'' colleague and
former lover.<
Anthony Willis, 47, ``flipped'' when he discovered 22-year-old Lynn Freeman
had begun a relationship with another servant who lived in the room next to
his.<
Claiming she had ``ruined'' his life, he warned the woman she was ``playing
with fire'' and would have to die.<
``I have been thinking about it for months. I'm going to hit you on the back
of the head with a hammer,'' he warned her during a late-night phone call.<
``I don't care if I go to prison. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill
you. I won't be happy until you're dead.''<
But Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court heard that despite the chilling threats,
the woman he had once loved became concerned about his clearly distressed state
and phoned him back in a bid to calm him down.<
Next day she went to the police and complained about what had happened.<
Willis, who is understood to have worked for the Royal Household for 25 years,
was arrested some hours later at a mental hospital he had been admitted to a
short while earlier.<
Passing sentence Judge Henry Blacksell QC told the once highly-regarded Palace
employee, who now plans a new life in a Dorset religious retreat, that his
previous good character and the fact he no longer represented a threat meant he
could be put on probation.<
``For the majority of your working life you have worked faithfully and
honourably for your employers.<
``You considered it a privilege to be able to work for them and you discharged
your employment with credit,'' he said. <
References written on his behalf backed up that view.<
The judge told Willis that his breakdown and the ``very troublesome period''
that followed were in part due to responsibilities at work that he increasingly
found it very hard to cope with.<
This in turn led to a breakdown in his relationship with Ms Freeman and the
threats that then followed.<
``In my view there are quite exceptional circumstances here in this sad affair
... and I have no doubt you present no continuing threat to anybody.<
``You have lost your employment and you are now somebody who has lived a
relatively isolated life because of that employment... I hope you can put this
sad episode behind you for the remainder of your life.''<
