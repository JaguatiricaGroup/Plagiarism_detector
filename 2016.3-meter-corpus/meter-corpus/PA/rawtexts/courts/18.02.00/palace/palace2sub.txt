            11:50 18/02/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Palace Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The court heard that Willis had devoted more than half of his life to serving
royalty, first as a Palace footman and senior page and, after his breakdown, as
a gardener at Windsor Castle.<
Ms Freeman, less than half his age, was a clerk in the Privy Purse and
Treasurer's office when their relationship began in April 1998.<
But nine months later he began to worry about the considerable age difference
between them and after explaining to the woman that he felt it was not a
``properly sustainable'' relationship, they ``amicably'' agreed to call it a
day. <
However, said Louis Madly, prosecuting, it was ``not a clean break.<
``He continued to request attention and sometimes he said he wanted to give
the relationship another try. Sometimes communications between the two were less
than amicable.''<
Things then calmed down for a while, but flared once more in October last year
when he learned his ex-girlfriend had started a new relationship with another
Palace employee.<
``It appears this knowledge upset him and led him to pursue the course of
conduct which is now complained of.''<
The barrister said that after a night's drinking he phoned Ms Freeman and told
her he had been telling his friends that he was going to kill her.<
With her new boyfriend listening in on an extension, she phoned Willis back in
a bid to calm him down, but the threats continued.<
The next day, after asking Palace officials for advice, she contacted police.<
They found him at the hospital and felt they had no choice but to arrest him
when he repeated his intentions to officers.<
In a later interview he said: ``She has ruined my life and she has got to
pay.''<
He added that he had ``flipped'' when he found out about the new man in her
life and ``fully intended'' that she should believe the death threat.<
