EX-TV PRESENTER DRIVING CAR WAS FIVE TIMES OVER THE LIMITED<
By Matthew Cooper, PA News<
An unemployed television presenter and reporter found unconscious at the wheel
of her car was so drunk that officers were forced to throw water in her face to
revive her, a court heard today.<
Ex-MUTV and L!ve TV journalist Philippa Gant, 31, was more than five times the
legal drink-drive limit when she was arrested on the afternoon of last Christmas
Eve, Crewe Magistrates Court was told.<
Gant, of Nassau Road, Barnes, south-west London, was committed for sentence at
Chester Crown Court after pleading guilty to drink-driving and dangerous driving
on the M6 in Cheshire.<
Jane Large, prosecuting, said Gant was arrested after her silver Audi Coupe
was spotted meandering across all three lanes of the motorway.<
The reporter, who was said to be travelling at about 30mph, took two breath
tests which revealed she had 179 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath, more
than five times the legal limit of 35 micrograms.<
Ms Large said the TV journalist eventually stopped her car in the middle of
the carriageway on the B5078, just 20 metres from junction 16 of the M6.<
The prosecutor told the court: ``The vehicle lights were on and the engine was
running. Philippa Gant was sitting upright in her seat with her head slumped on
her chest.<
``Officers thought she was seriously injured or very ill as she appeared to be
unconscious. Police slapped her face and requested an ambulance. One of the
officers then threw some water into the defendant's face and that seemed to
bring her to.<
``It then became quite clear that drink was the cause of her condition and the
ambulance was cancelled,'' she said.<
Magistrates were told that Gant, who claimed she had driven from Manchester,
also had a bottle of red wine in her vehicle.<
Anthony Barnfather, defending, said his client accepted that her behaviour was
``nothing short of outrageous'' and that a major accident had only been avoided
by good fortune.<
The effects of alcohol on Gant may have been worsened by beta-blockers, he
said.<
The lawyer added that Gant had been unemployed since July last year after her
TV career was cut short following a panic attack live on air.<
He said: ``In the days leading up to Christmas she consumed a very, very large
amount of spirits, I would say an unbelievably large amount of spirits, and on
that day she had drunk one or two glasses of wine.''<
The reporter, who was released on unconditional bail, will be sentenced on a
date to be fixed.<
