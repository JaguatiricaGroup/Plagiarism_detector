BASEBALL BAT HUNT SABOTEUR LOSES #52,000 DAMAGES AWARD<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
A veteran hunt saboteur who won #52,000 damages from a farmer who retaliated
after he was attacked with a baseball bat today had the award taken away by
three senior judges.<
The Court of Appeal ruled that farmer William Kirkby was acting in self
defence when he wrested away the bat and struck Harry Cross on the side of the
head, fracturing his skull.<
Lord Justice Beldam said the injury, which has led to Mr Cross suffering
epileptic fits, was a result of his own ``criminal and unlawful'' acts in
threatening and attacking Mr Kirkby.<
A High Court judge sitting in Grimsby last year had ruled that Mr Cross was
entitled to the damages because Mr Kirkby, of Swallow Lane, Wootton, North
Lincs, had used excessive force and the defence of acting in self defence was
not open to him.<
