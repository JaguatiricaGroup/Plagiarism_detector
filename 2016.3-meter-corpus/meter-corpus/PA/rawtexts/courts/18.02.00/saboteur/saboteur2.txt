But Lord Justice Beldam said Judge Richard Inglis, when he made his ruling,
overlooked the fact that Mr Kirkby ``had done what he thought was necessary in
the anguish of the moment'' when he was being attacked.<
Lord Justice Judge said Mr Kirkby, 55, should not have been expected to
measure the violence he meted out to 47-year-old Mr Cross with ``mathematical
precision'' to comply with the law.<
Mr Cross, of Halesworth, Suffolk, and his partner, Margaret Davis, were on Mr
Kirkby's land in October 1992 during a meeting of the Brocklesby Hunt, intending
to disrupt it.<
Mr Kirkby, who had had to give up hunting after a fall from a horse injured
his shoulder, escorted Miss Davis off his land.<
The farmer had used ``reasonable force'' to remove her after she bit him and
sat on the ground but Mr Cross, a hunt saboteur for 20 years, threatened to kill
Mr Kirkby, said Lord Justice Beldam.<
Mr Cross punched and kicked the farmer on his way to his car parked nearby,
from which he took a baseball bat and Miss Davis took a metal bar.<
Lord Justice Judge said Mr Cross ``became abusive and threatening'' and in a
rage smashed the bat into the ground, breaking it along its 24in length.<
