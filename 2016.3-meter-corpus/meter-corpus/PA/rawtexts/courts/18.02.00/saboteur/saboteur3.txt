Mr Kirkby was ``thoroughly alarmed'' by Mr Cross's behaviour and asked a
neighbour to call the police as Mr Cross pushed him into a hedge with the bat.<
The farmer tried to walk away but was hit twice by Mr Cross, ``who was looking
for a fight'', on the arm and shoulder.<
When Mr Kirkby retaliated, he grabbed the bat and without swinging it or
raising it above his head, hit Mr Cross a single blow.<
Lord Justice Judge said the blow was ``not in revenge, or to teach him a
lesson or give him a good hiding''.<
But the farmer believed he was facing a severe threat of further violence and
was trying to defend himself.<
``These beliefs were entirely justified. The blow ended the fight and the bat
was thrown out of harm's way.<
``Although seriously injured, the claimant (Cross) was prepared to continue
the fight and tried to retrieve the bat which was picked up by a witness.''<
The judge added: ``In these circumstances it is not tenable to stigmatise what
Mr Kirkby had done as an overreaction or unreasonable under the situation facing
him.''<
He said the trial judge had been wrong to ``weigh too nicely'' the degree of
force used by Mr Kirkby when defending himself while he was under attack.<
``It is not fair to stand back and say that was too much force and that was
not self defence. You have to be realistic and if he has to use more force than
was strictly necessary to defend himself, that should not prevent him using the
defence of self defence.''<
