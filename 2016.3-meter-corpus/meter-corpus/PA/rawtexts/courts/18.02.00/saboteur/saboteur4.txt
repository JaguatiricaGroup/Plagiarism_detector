                13:14 18/02/00: Page 4 (HHH) COURTS Saboteur
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lord Justice Beldam said Mr Cross had committed several ``serious criminal
offences'' before Mr Kirkby hit him.<
He had an offensive weapon, had caused an affray, had threatened to kill Mr
Kirkby and had assaulted him causing bodily harm.<
Although Mr Cross was continuing to attack the farmer, Mr Kirkby was ``clearly
seeking to avoid further confrontation'' and had to protect himself from further
violence.<
The judge said the courts should not permit Mr Cross to benefit from what were
criminal offences on his part and appear to ``turn a blind eye'' to his serious
attack on Mr Kirkby.<
Mr Cross's original award had been reduced from an agreed #130,000 because
Judge Inglis had ruled that the saboteur was 60% to blame for the injury.<
He was legally aided throughout the court battle and the legal aid board will
now have to pay Mr Kirkby's court costs.<
