WOMAN TELLS COURT OF ALLERGIES NIGHTMARE<
By Paul Hunter, PA News<
A woman today told a court how everyday items including sweets, perfume and
toiletries can cause her massive allergic reactions.<
Heather Brown was giving evidence at Dundee Sheriff Court, where her estranged
husband, Colin Slane, is accused of assaulting her by placing shampoo on her
door handle, knowing she would suffer a reaction to the substance if she touched
it.<
The incident is alleged to have taken place at her home in Byron Street,
Dundee, on January 22 last year.<
Mr Slane is further accused of assaulting her by spitting in her face and
damaging her car by jumping on the bonnet and stamping on the roof in Byron
Street on August 22, 1998.<
Mr Slane denies both charges.<
Because of Ms Brown's severe condition, the court hearing was subject to
strict controls. Everyone entering the courtroom had to give an undertaking they
were not wearing items such as perfumes and aftershave.<
Two reporters were kept outside the locked courtroom because one admitted
wearing deodorant and other had been eating mints.<
Ms Brown, 33, told the court she suffered multiple allergies including food
stuffs such as peanuts.<
She said her problems began when she worked as a bouncer at a night club in
the city, formerly known as Distills, in 1995 when she took a sip of the fizzy
drink Irn Bru and had a reaction.<
Ms Brown subsequently went on to work as a store detective and told the court
she no longer works. She added that she was a season ticket holder at Ibrox,
home of Rangers in Glasgow but said she had not attended any matches this season
because of fears it would set off her condition.<
She said she had suffered around 50 different episodes with varying degrees of
reaction since the problem first developed five years ago. Around 10 of these
produced anaphylactic shock.<
She told the court that this is an extremely severe reaction in which
chemicals called histamines are produced by the body.<
Symptoms include swollen throat and face, puffy eyes and drops in blood
pressure followed by dizziness and loss of consciousness.<
