DOCTOR TELLS COURT OF WOMAN'S ALLERGY NIGHTMARE<
By Paul Hunter, PA News<
A doctor today told a court how a woman who suffers massive allergic reactions
to sweets, perfume and toiletries could die if she did not receive appropriate
medical treatment.<
Dr Susan Morley was giving evidence at Dundee Sheriff Court, where Colin Slane
is accused of assaulting his estranged wife Heather Brown by placing shampoo on
her door handle, knowing she would suffer a reaction to the substance if she
touched it.<
The incident is alleged to have taken place at Ms Brown's home in Byron
Street, Dundee, on January 22 last year.<
Mr Slane is further accused of assaulting her by spitting in her face and
damaging her car by jumping on the bonnet and stamping on the roof in the same
street on August 22, 1998.<
Mr Slane, of Clepington Road, Dundee, denies both charges.<
Due to Ms Brown's severe condition, the court hearing was subject to strict
controls. Everyone entering the courtroom had to give an undertaking they were
not wearing items such as perfumes and aftershave.<
Two reporters were today kept outside the locked courtroom because one
admitted wearing deodorant and other had been eating mints.<
Dr Morley, a dermatologist based at the city's Ninewells Hospital, said she
had seen Ms Brown on a number of occasions regarding her problem.<
The doctor said there was a huge range of items Ms Brown was allergic to,
adding that it was impossible to quantify the list of items which could cause
her difficulties.<
However Dr Morley said the list included food additives, perfume compounds and
medicines such as penicillin, antibiotics and painkillers.<
She added that it was impossible to say Ms Brown would be allergic to all
shampoos but added that most shampoos contain perfume compounds.<
The dermatologist noted that Ms Brown had been admitted to Ninewells on
numerous occasions suffering anaphylactic shock.<
This condition results in the body producing chemicals known as histamines
which give rise to symptoms including swollen throat and face, puffy eyes and
drops in blood pressure followed by dizziness and loss of consciousness.<
Dr Morley said there was a risk of death if Ms Brown was not helped when
suffering from an anaphylactic shock.<
She added that the condition is usually brought on by inhalation of vapour
from substances including shampoo and the zest of citric fruits.<
Dr Morley said that she had been consulted by Ms Brown shortly after the
incident in which the shampoo was allegedly placed on the door handle.<
In a pre-arranged appointment, Ms Brown discussed what had happened. Dr Morley
said: ``It must have been a situation where vapour was present. If you are
smelling it then you are inhaling it.''<
Earlier Ms Brown, 33, had told the court she suffered multiple allergies and
that after discussion with Dr Morley accepted that the incident at her home had
produced a minor reaction.<
Ms Brown said her problems began in 1995 when she took a sip of the fizzy
drink Irn Bru and had a reaction while working as a bouncer at a night-club in
the city, formerly known as Distills. <
Mr Brown subsequently went on to work as a store detective and told the court
she was no longer in employment. She added that she was a season ticket holder
at Ibrox, home of Rangers in Glasgow, but said she had not attended any matches
this season because of fears it would set off her condition.<
She said she had suffered around 50 different episodes with varying degrees of
reaction since the problem first developed, and among these were around ten
incidents of anaphylactic shock.<
Ms Brown said she had touched the door handle after returning from dropping
her teenage son off at school, and had experienced a reaction to the gel-like
substance.<
``I had an itchy neck and the bottom of my face was itchy and it felt tight
around my chin.''<
She said she then took an antihistamine tablet before phoning a solicitor
rather than the police.<
``I was not sure if I would be laughed at if I phoned the police.''<
Ms Brown added that Mr Slane, 28, was fully aware of substances which might
produce a reaction in her.<
She spoke of an incident where she had visited a hairdressers and had suffered
a severe reaction when she ate a mint.<
``I take my life in my hands every single day but that's my choice.''<
The hearing was adjourned until Monday.<
