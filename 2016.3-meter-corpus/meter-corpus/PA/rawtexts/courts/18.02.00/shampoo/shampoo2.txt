                 15:14 18/02/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Shampoo
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Referring to the shampoo incident, she said on the day in question she had been
taking her teenage son to school. He had noticed some gel like liquid on the
handle and told her about it.<
When asked by Alan Kempton, fiscal depute, how she felt at that point, she
said: ``I was okay once I stepped away from the door.<
``I said to myself that it looked as if someone had put something there. My
mind was going in to overdrive thinking `Who would have done this?'. Physically
I was okay.''<
She said it took around 20 minutes to drop her son off at school and return
and she demonstrated to the court how she touched the handle with two fingers
while attempting not to touch the substance.<
However some of the gel apparently dripped form the handle on to her little
finger and she started to feel dizzy. Ms Brown said: ``I rubbed my thumb over my
pinkie to make it disappear.''<
Ms Brown said that she then went into her house and added: ``I rubbed my thumb
over my pinkie to make it disappear, to rub it away.<
``I sat on the stairs and I got a bit breathless. Then I thought, `I'm going
to have to get myself off these stairs.' I turned around, came up the stairs,
went into the kitchen and took an antihistamine tablet.<
``I had an itchy neck and the bottom of my face was itchy and I felt tight
around my chin.''<
Ms Brown then told the court that she phoned a solicitor rather than the
police.<
``I was not sure if I would be laughed at if I phoned the police.''<
