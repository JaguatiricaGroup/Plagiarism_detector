Ms Brown said she did not wash her hand immediately after the gel touched her
skin.<

because the damage had already been done by this stage.''<
She was also asked how long the effects of the incident had lasted and replied
she had felt uncomfortable for around one hour.<
The court heard she later saw a dermatologist who agreed that she had suffered
a minor reaction as a result of touching the gel.<

she had been accompanied by Mr Slane, 28.<
Sheriff Richard Davidson asked if Mr Slane would have known what would produce
a reaction and Ms Brown said her estranged husband knew everything she was
allergic to.<
She described an incident where she had visited a hairdressers and suffered a
severe reaction when she ate a mint sweet.<
Ms Brown added that she has been given adrenaline injections on more than 20
