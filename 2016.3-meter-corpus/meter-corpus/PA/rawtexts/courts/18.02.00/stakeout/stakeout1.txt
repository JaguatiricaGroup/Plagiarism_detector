BATTERED EX-PC WINS NEGLIGENCE CLAIM OVER BACK-UP FAILURE<
By Alistair Keely, PA News<
A police officer who was badly beaten up when colleagues failed to respond to
his radio calls for help today won his case for negligence against West Midlands
Police.<
David Mullaney, 34, was repeatedly kicked in the head and was left unconscious
after the attack, which happened during a stake-out in Coventry, West Midlands.<
The court heard how Pc Dermot McKirdy was meant to be monitoring radio
messages on the shift, but was drunk and failed to alert colleagues to Mr
Mullaney's plight.<
Mr Mullaney was left alone on duty during a stake-out in March 1994 to catch
gay men who were using toilets as a pick-up point.<
When a man exposed himself Mr Mullaney tried to arrest him and a violent
struggle took place in which his head was smashed into a grille and he was
repeatedly kicked in the head for about 30 seconds.<
The court was told that Mr Mullaney, who has since resigned from the force,
repeatedly asked for help on his radio.<
Recorder John Mitting QC, sitting as deputy High Court Judge in Birmingham,
said Mr Mullaney was an honest police officer who was trying to do his duty.<
He said: ``There was a serious dereliction of duty by Pc McKirdy and a cover
up of that dereliction of duty by the creation of a false log.<
``The failure to hear and respond to four radio messages is due, I am
satisfied, to Pc McKirdy's absence from his post. No explanation has been
offered for that.''<
He also criticised two police constables for being ``unsatisfactory''
witnesses when they came to give evidence.<
The court heard that Pc McKirdy has since left West Midlands Police after he
committed a drink driving offence.<
The case was adjourned for a hearing to assess how much damages should be
awarded to Mr Mullaney, who was also awarded costs.<
After the case Mr Mullaney's legal representative said his client still
suffered from health problems.<
Gerry O'Brien said: ``He is extremely pleased by the result. He wishes to
thank his family and friends who have helped during this difficult time.<
``He is now looking forward to the damages being assessed quickly.''<
A spokesman for West Midlands Police said it was considering an appeal.<
