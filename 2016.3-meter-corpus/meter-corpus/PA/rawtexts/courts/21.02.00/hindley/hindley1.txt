HINDLEY'S FREEDOM BATTLE GOES TO LORDS<
By Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Moors murderer Myra Hindley was making her latest bid for freedom at the House
of Lords today.<
Her lawyers will tell the highest court in the land that she should not be
condemned to die behind bars without the chance of parole.<
Hindley has now spent 33 years in jail following her conviction at the age of
23 at Chester Crown Court in May 1966 of the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10
and Edward Evans, 17.<
Her challenge before the Law Lords follows a Court of Appeal ruling in
November 1998 which upheld the decision of successive home secretaries that her
life sentence ``must mean life''.<
If her House of Lords plea fails the 57-year-old will have exhausted all legal
avenues under domestic law.<
But her lawyers could still move to take her case to the European Court of
Human Rights.<
In 1998 three judges in the Court of Appeal in London unanimously dismissed
Hindley's appeal against her ``whole life'' tariff.<
Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, sitting with two other judges, said at
the time that the court's ruling meant that Hindley ``could well serve another
30 years or more in prison'' for what were horrendous crimes.<
When Home Secretary Jack Straw confirmed earlier decisions that Hindley should
stay behind bars for life, there was a caveat that she could be considered for
parole in ``exceptional circumstances''.<
Hindley's one remaining hope, if the House of Lords bid fails, is that Mr
Straw or his successors, who are legally bound to keep her case under review,
decide that ``exceptional circumstances'' have arisen entitling her to parole.<
Her lawyers argue that leaving her without any hope of parole offends against
basic principles of sentencing and justice and that she is being treated
unfairly as a result of her notoriety in the press and media.<
After the Court of Appeal ruling, a spokesman for Mr Straw said an appeal to
the House of Lords would be ``strongly contested''.<
