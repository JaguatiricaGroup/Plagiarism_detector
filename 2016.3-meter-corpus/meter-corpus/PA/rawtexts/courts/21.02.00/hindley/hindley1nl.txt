DENYING HINDLEY PAROLE IS `INHUMANE AND DEGRADING'<
By John Aston and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Denying Moors murderer Myra Hindley hope of parole was condemned in the House
of Lords today as ``inhumane and degrading treatment''.<
Five Law Lords were told it was also unlawful, irrational and
``disproportionate'' to rule out release, except in exceptional circumstances,
for the woman jailed for taking part with Ian Brady in horrific child killings.<
Launching her latest bid for freedom, Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC described
Hindley as a ``reformed'' person who presented no danger to society.<
He asked the Lords to overturn a Court of Appeal ruling in November 1998 which
upheld the decision of successive Home Secretaries that her life sentence ``must
mean life''.<
The QC said Hindley, 57, was now in her 35th year of imprisonment following
her conviction at the age of 23 at Chester Crown Court in May 1966 of the
murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10 and Edward Evans, 17.<
In a test case which could affect other notorious killers, he said it was a
fundamental injustice to impose a whole-life tariff in 1990 _ a punishment of
unique severity _ when such a concept did not exist at the time of sentencing.<
``There is no dispute that her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserving
of punishment,'' said Mr Fitzgerald.<
``But there is uncontradictable evidence that she has reformed and presents no
danger to society.''<
The Parole Board had confirmed she had a case to be considered for release on
licence by recommending her move to an open prison.<
But, Mr Fitzgerald added, that case could not be properly put while she was
still subject to a ``whole-life'' tariff.<
He told Lord Browne-Wilkinson, sitting with Lords Nicholls, Steyn, Hutton and
Hobhouse, that today's challenge was to the legality of whole-life tariffs in
general, as well as to the particular sentence imposed on Hindley.<
The Home Secretary had recently been asked to reconsider Hindley's tariff on
the grounds that she had made ``exceptional progress'', but he had indicated
there would be no decision until the case before the Lords was concluded.<
Parliament had given no express authority for creating a whole-life tariff
category of punishment, and neither was there an implied authority, said Mr
Fitzgerald.<
``It is our submission that Parliament did not intend such a policy to be
adopted whereby lifelong tariffs were pre-determined on the grounds of gravity
of the crime alone.''<
No minimum recommendation as to the term she should serve before being
considered for parole was made at the time of Hindley's sentence _ ``and no
suggestion was made for the next 20 years that she would be subject to a
whole-life tariff''.<
He added: ``It is our submission that the increase cannot be justified by her
confessions in 1987 and that it should not be justified, as it apparently was,
by the fact that higher tariffs had started to be fixed from 1988 onwards.''<
An increase ``of this magnitude cannot rationally be justified''.<
Whole-life tariffs, when imposed on young adults, amounted to a punitive
punishment, said counsel.<
Hindley and others sentenced in their early twenties ``will be punished with
unique severity''.<
If her House of Lords plea fails, Hindley will have exhausted all legal
avenues under domestic law.<
But her lawyers could still explore the possibility of further challenges
under European human rights legislation.<
Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, who rejected the Hindley case in the
Court of Appeal along with two other judges, said at the time that the court's
ruling meant that Hindley ``could well serve another 30 years or more in
prison'' for what were horrendous crimes.<
Hindley's one remaining hope, if the House of Lords bid fails, is that Mr
Straw or his successors, who are legally bound to keep her case under review,
decide that ``exceptional circumstances'' have arisen entitling her to parole.<
The hearing, expected to last four days, was adjourned until tomorrow.<
