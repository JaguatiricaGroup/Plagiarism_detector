REFORMED HINDLEY IS A VICTIM, LAW LORDS TOLD<
By John Aston and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Moors murderer Myra Hindley is a ``reformed'' person who presents no danger to
society, the House of Lords was told today as she made her latest bid for
freedom.<
She was herself the victim of ``a basic injustice'', having been unlawfully
condemned to die in prison with no hope of parole, said Mr Edward Fitzgerald
QC.<
He told five Law Lords that Hindley, aged 57, was now in her 35th year of
imprisonment following her conviction at the age of 23 at Chester Crown Court in
May 1966 of the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10 and Edward Evans, 17.<
``There is no dispute that her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserving
of punishment,'' said Mr Fitzgerald.<
``But there is uncontradictable evidence that she has reformed and presents no
danger to society.''<
Mr Fitzgerald was launching her Lords challenge, expected to last four days,
against a Court of Appeal ruling in November 1998 which upheld the decision of
successive Home Secretaries that her life sentence ``must mean life''.<
He said she had a case for release, and that the Parole Board had confirmed it
by recommending her move to an open prison.<
But, he added, that case could not be properly put while she was still subject
to a ``whole-life'' tariff.<
The QC told Lord Browne-Wilkinson, sitting with Lords Nicholls, Steyn, Hutton
and Hobhouse, that today's challenge was to the legality of whole-life tariffs
in general, as well as to the particular sentence imposed on Hindley.<
