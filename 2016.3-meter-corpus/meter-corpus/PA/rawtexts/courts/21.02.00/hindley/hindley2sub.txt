           12:30 21/02/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Hindley substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parliament had given no express authority for creating a whole-life tariff
category of punishment, and neither was there an implied authority, said Mr
Fitzgerald.<
``We say it is positively to the contrary of Parliament's intent.<
``It is our submission that Parliament did not intend such a policy to be
adopted whereby lifelong tariffs were pre-determined on the grounds of gravity
of the crime alone.''<
At the most it provided for a recommendation of minimum tariffs and did not
contemplate a category of prisoner untouchable by parole for whom release from
prison on licence could not be contemplated, except under the test of
``exceptional circumstances''.<
If her House of Lords plea fails, Hindley will have exhausted all legal
avenues under domestic law.<
But her lawyers could still explore the possibility of further challenges
under European human rights legislation.<
In 1998 three judges in the Court of Appeal in London unanimously dismissed
Hindley's appeal against her lifelong tariff.<
Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, sitting with two other judges, said at
the time that the court's ruling meant that Hindley ``could well serve another
30 years or more in prison'' for what were horrendous crimes.<
When Home Secretary Jack Straw confirmed earlier decisions that Hindley should
stay behind bars for life, there was a caveat that she could be considered for
parole in ``exceptional circumstances''.<
Hindley's one remaining hope, if the House of Lords bid fails, is that Mr
Straw or his successors, who are legally bound to keep her case under review,
decide that ``exceptional circumstances'' have arisen entitling her to parole.<
Her lawyers will argue during the current hearing that leaving her without any
hope of parole offends against basic principles of sentencing and justice and
that she is being treated unfairly as a result of her notoriety in the press and
media.<
