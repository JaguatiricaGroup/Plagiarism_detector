MOTHER JAILED FOR ROTTING RODENT PROTEST<
By Nick Allen, PA News<
A disgruntled constituent was today jailed for two weeks for sending a
maggot-infested mouse through the post to her MP.<
Mother-of-two Mee San Lee-Reed, 50, sent the decomposing rodent to David
Jamieson, Labour MP for Plymouth Devonport, along with a note which read: ``Nazi
Scum, you are dead''.<
The package was opened by Mr Jamieson's wife at their home last July, Plymouth
Crown Court heard.<
She also sent a dead rodent to Plymouth City Council offices, where the
``unusual smelling package'' was intercepted by a postal supervisor, the court
heard.<
Lee-Reed, of Abney Close, Plymouth, pleaded guilty to two charges of sending
indecent or obscene material and asked for four other offences to be taken into
consideration.<
Prosecutor Hugh Cornford told the hearing she had also sent dog faeces and
sanitary towels covered in tomato and soya sauce to people she had a grudge
against.<
In mitigation, Nick Lewin said Lee-Reed felt let down by her MP in her efforts
to find out more about the murder of her relatives in her native Indonesia.<
She also held a grudge against Plymouth City Council following a rent dispute
which caused her losses of #40,000, he said.<
``When you talk to her about money, Mr Jamieson and the city council, she
totally and utterly loses it,'' he said.<
``She told me she would continue to offend in this way until someone listens
to her.<
``She is not a vicious and unpleasant woman but a sad one.''<
Sentencing Lee-Reed, Assistant Recorder Martin Picton said she had left the
courts with no choice but to send her to prison.<
He said: ``However genuinely you held your grievances against those people you
sent these packages, it cannot justify acting the way you did.''<
