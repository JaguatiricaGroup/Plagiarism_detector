POLICEMAN `CAUGHT ON CCTV' DENIES ASSAULT<
By Tim Clarke, PA News<
A policeman caught on camera apparently slamming the head of a man against a
panda car while arresting him, today denied assaulting him.<
Pc Michael Anthony Hughes, 36, is charged with assaulting Adam Lamonby while
on duty in Bournemouth one Friday night last April.<
Weymouth Magistrates' Court was shown a closed circuit television recording
which showed the events surrounding Mr Lamonby's arrest, including, the
prosecution alleged, the officer ``bouncing his head off the back windscreen of
his patrol car''.<
At the opening of the trial this morning, prosecuting solicitor Gareth Evans
said that after Pc Hughes noticed the CCTV camera on Westover Road in
Bournemouth, his partner then appeared to try and conceal the treatment of Mr
Lamonby by standing in front of the lens.<
Mr Evans told the court: ``The prosecution would say that this officer's whole
demeanour was of someone not in fear of his own safety. He was a man on a
mission.<
``A police officer is entitled to use reasonable force during an arrest if
they believe it to be necessary. On no basis can what the defendant did that
night be justified as reasonable.''<
Denying one charge of common assault, Pc Hughes had said he was confronted
with a baying mob of youths.<
But Mr Evans said the group of four men on the video appeared to be standing
calmly waiting for a taxi, one of them with his hands in his pockets.<
Following Lamonby's arrest, he and his friend Shaun Stubbs, who was also
arrested, were immediately released by the custody sergeant at Bournemouth
police station without charge. They had been detained for being drunk and
disorderly.<
The court were told that the controller of CCTV cameras in Bournemouth, Simon
Trowbridge, recorded the incident after observing the arrest of Stubbs.<
Mr Trowbridge sent the tape to the Dorset Police, who launched an internal
investigation. <
Criminal proceedings were then started.<
