  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Lamonby, 20, told the court that, along with a group of friends, he had
visited Woody's public house in Bournemouth before leaving to catch a taxi at
around 11pm.<
The group had been singing football songs on their short walk, some involving
AFC Bournemouth and others relating to Manchester United.<
He told the court: ``I had seen my friend arrested and told the officer that I
thought it was out of order.<
``He then grabbed me, took me over the road and threw me against the car so
hard that it winded me. He then handcuffed me and twisted my wrist so the cuffs
tightened.<
``I was in so much pain I couldn't say anything _ it was hurting so much I
could not speak.''<
Mr Lamonby, who had moved to Dorset from Manchester just weeks before the
incident, was then taken into custody where he claims he was told by Pc Hughes
that ``he should be used to this being a Manc''.<
The complainant, who suffers from asthma, suffered bruises to the chest and
head, as well as cuts to the wrist where he was handcuffed in the alleged
assault.<
In cross-examination Brian Sharman, defending Hughes, said the group had been
chanting abuse at the police car as it drove past and that is why the pair were
arrested.<
He said Mr Lamonby had completely lost control after seeing his friend
arrested and had struggled vigorously against his detention.<
Mr Lamonby replied: ``I didn't want to be treated the way I was. I had to
fight against it because I was in so much pain.''<
The trial, which is due to last three days, continues at Weymouth Magistrates
tomorrow.<
