WATER FIRM FINED #250,000 OVER POLLUTION INCIDENT<
By Jon Coates, PA News<
Thames Water was today ordered to pay #250,000 for polluting the River Thames
and flooding 10 homes with a cocktail of raw untreated sewage and dangerous
industrial chemicals.<
Most of the families living in the houses in Erith, Kent, have not been able
to return to their homes since the effluent poured into them in November 1998.<
After being evacuated they spent the Christmas period in hotels, before being
transferred to rented accommodation.<
An Environment Agency spokesman said Thames Water has had to buy eight of the
homes as they are not fit to live in.<
Greg Holland, the company's operations manager, today apologised for the
incident and said it was refurbishing the eight homes at the request of the
residents.<
In a hearing at Croydon Crown Court, the water company was today fined #50,000
for polluting the River Thames and #200,000 for disposing of waste in a manner
likely to cause harm to human health.<
It was also ordered to pay court costs of nearly #13,000.<
The company had pleaded guilty to the charges at a hearing at Bexley
Magistrates Court on January 14 this year, but the magistrates decided its
sentencing powers were insufficient and committed the matter to a Crown Court.<
The Environment Agency spokesman said a series of errors and an illegal pump
connection at Fraser Road foul pumping station in Erith resulted in a surface
pumping station in nearby Sandcliff Road becoming contaminated with raw sewage
and industrial effluent.<
He said: ``This caused an estimated five million gallons of effluent to be
pumped into the River Thames.<
``A further total failure of the pumps at the surface water pumping station
resulted in the effluent _ which could no longer be pumped into the river _ to
flow into the street via road gullies.''<
It was this that caused the 10 homes in Sandcliff Road to be flooded with the
sewage and chemicals on the night of November 25-26.<
The spokesman added: ``Residents, including young children, suffered great
personal loss being compelled to leave their homes at very short notice, some
with only the clothes they stood in.<
``The affected properties have remained unfit for the families to return to
and eight out of the 10 have now been purchased by Thames Water.''<
He said due to the toxicity of the chemicals involved, the families were
monitored by Bexley and Greenwich health authorities as well as the Chemical
Incident Response Unit of Guy's Hospital in London.<
``Some suffered from acute short-term effects of exposure to the chemicals.''<
Mr Holland said: ``We very much regret the flooding to these homes and the
disruption caused to the families who lived there.<
``Ever since the incident occurred we have made every effort to put things
right for the families affected.<
``This has been a terrible ordeal for them and we apologise for the serious
inconvenience they have suffered.''<
He added: ``Measures have been put in place to prevent a recurrence of this
incident in our region.''<
Mr Holland said loss adjusters acting for Thames Water have been liaising with
the families affected to ensure they are fairly compensated.<
The Environment Agency spokesman said it has prosecuted Thames Water 24 times
since 1995, with 20 of these relating to allowing sewage into watercourses.<
He said last year the water company was fined #25,000 at Croydon Crown Court
and #12,000 at Bexley Magistrates Court for sewage offences.<
It was also fined #12,000 at Enfield Magistrates Court in 1997 for a sewage
offence, #15,000 at Brent Magistrates a year earlier for causing oil pollution,
and #12,000 at Romford Magistrates Court in 1995 for a sewage offence.<
