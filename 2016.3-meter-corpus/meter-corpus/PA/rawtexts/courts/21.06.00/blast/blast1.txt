NAIL BOMB KILLER WAS NOT MENTALLY ILL, COURT TOLD<
By Shenai Raif and Pat Clarke, PA News<
Nail bomber David Copeland was not mentally ill when he planted three bombs in
London killing three people and wounding 129, according to a prosecution
psychiatrist at his murder trial today.<
Dr Philip Joseph told the Old Bailey that in his opinion, Copeland's psychotic
symptoms may have emerged after his arrest and detention at Belmarsh prison.<
But at the time he planted the bombs in April last year, Copeland had a
personality disorder which would not have impaired his responsibility.<
Other doctors had reported an improvement in Copeland's mental state after he
was transferred to Broadmoor secure hospital and given medication.<
Dr Joseph said: ``Assuming he was ill in the first place, he still maintains
his white supremacy beliefs and hopes the bombing campaign he started will
continue.''<
A personality disorder meant he ``retains sufficient choice, will power and
ability to decide whether to carry out the bombings or not,'' said the doctor.<
``I believe he wanted to whether not he felt compelled to.''<
Dr Joseph said Copeland felt ``extreme rage towards others leading to his
drive to destroy'', and had fears about his sexual orientation and a sense of
isolation.<
Copeland's symptoms suggested developmental and personality problems dating
back to the age of 13.<
``He is an extreme fantasist. He dreams about being powerful because he is so
small and weak and fearful,'' said the doctor.<
``His personal disorder stems from an overwhelming feeling of
insignificance.''<
Dr Joseph was called to answer a number of defence psychiatrists who told the
court that Copeland was mentally ill and had felt compelled by God to bomb as a
start to the end of the world.<
In a statement read in court, Professor John Gunn said Copeland was suffering
from paranoid schizophrenia.<
Copeland, 24, an engineer from Cove, Farnborough, Hants, had admitted causing
explosions at Brixton, south London, Brick Lane, east London and Soho, central
London, within 13 days in April last year.<
The blast in Soho _ at the mainly gay Admiral Duncan pub _ killed three
people: Andrea Dykes, 27, who was pregnant, and friends John Light, 32, and Nik
Moore, 31, from Essex.<
Copeland is being tried for their murder after the prosecution refused to
accept his plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished
responsibility.<
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.<
