BROADMOOR INMATES IN COURT BATTLE OVER VISITS<
By John Aston, PA News<
Inmates from Broadmoor top security hospital today won permission to bring a
test case challenge against new restrictions on visits from their children.<
Three patients, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were given the go-ahead
by a High Court judge to seek judicial review of the tough regime introduced at
Broadmoor, Berks, and two other special hospitals, Ashworth and Rampton.<
The sweeping changes followed a public inquiry into paedophilia and
pornography scandals on the wards of Ashworth hospital, Merseyside, which houses
some of the country's most notorious criminals.<
The independent investigation headed by Peter Fallon QC found that farcical
security arrangements meant inmates had access to pornography and visits from an
unaccompanied eight-year-old girl being ``groomed for paedophile purposes''.<
Last September a health service circular took effect restricting the
circumstances in which visits by children to patients were to be permitted.<
It stipulated that any child under 16 must be accompanied on visits by the
person living with the child who had parental responsibility, or by the person
with day-to-day care.<
Today Broadmoor patients detained under the Mental Health Act after committing
serious crimes were given permission by Mr Justice Scott Baker to challenge the
legality of that policy.<
They were ``D'', a convicted rapist held at the hospital for eight years;
``S'', convicted of manslaughter and armed robbery and held for 10 years, and
``R'', convicted of false imprisonment with a firearm and held for six years.
None of their crimes involved offences against children.<
All have children who used to visit them before the new restrictions made such
visits impossible because relationships had broken down with the child's
responsible parent - the mother - who was either unwilling or unable to
accompany the child.<
Before the new policy was introduced other members of the family, including
grandparents and sisters, would accompany the children to the hospital.<
In the case of S, he used to be regularly visited by his young nieces as well
as his teenage son.<
The judge gave all three permission to seek a High Court declaration that the
policy was being operated unlawfully and in breach of their rights.<
A full hearing is expected later this year.<
