SUPERMODEL NAOMI'S AUNT TELLS OF RACE INSULT<
By Helen William, PA News<
The policewoman aunt of supermodel Naomi Campbell told a court today of her
embarrassment and anger at being called a ``flat-nosed monkey'' by a colleague.<
Pc Sonia Campbell, 36, said she became ``unnerved'' and angry when Pc Peter
Ferguson, 42, pushed his nose down and made racial insults at a charity police
quiz night.<
Ferguson denies a charge under Section 5 of the Crime and Disorder Act of
using threatening and insulting words and behaviour which were racially
aggravated.<
Tower Bridge magistrates were told that the officers were off-duty last
November at Cleo's Wine Bar in Kensington, south west London, with more than 50
colleagues from Kensington Police Station when Ferguson became abusive.<
They were part of a six-member team which was huddled around a table trying to
identify pictures of celebrities when Ferguson _ known to  colleagues as Fungus
_ leaned back in his chair.<
Ms Campbell, who has been with the Metropolitan Police since 1993, said:
``Something drew my attention to him and I could see that he was pressing his
nose down. He was laughing smugly and I did not understand why he was doing
that.''<
The mother-of-two added: ``He was smiling and he was quite smug. He sat there
staring directly at me with a grin on his face.''<
He repeated the gesture ``as if he was taunting me'', she said.<
Later she was told by Tracey Jackson, the wife of a colleague, that Ferguson
had called her ``a flat-nosed monkey''.<
Ms Campbell said: ``I felt humiliated, insulted. I was the only black person
there amongst a group of white people. I felt embarrassed for them.<
``I did not want to go to the quiz night. A friend of mine had asked me to go,
and I thought what have I done to him to insult me. I felt very hurt and
insulted too.''<
