Pc FOUND GUILTY OF RACE SLUR TO SUPERMODEL'S AUNT<
By Helen William, PA News<
A police officer was today fined and is in danger of losing his job for
calling a colleague - the aunt of supermodel Naomi Campbell - a ``flat-nosed
monkey''.<
Pc Peter Ferguson, 42, was given three months to pay a #500 fine and #300
costs after being found guilty of using threatening or insulting words or
behaviour which were racially aggravated to Pc Sonia Campbell, 36.<
Stipendiary magistrate Shamoon Somjee, sitting at Tower Bridge Magistrates
Court, was told that Ferguson pushed his nose down and made racial insults to Ms
Campbell at a charity police quiz night in November.<
The officers were off duty at Cleo's Wine Bar in Kensington, south west
London, with more than 50 colleagues from Kensington police station when
Ferguson also told Pc Campbell that she looked like ``she could have gone six
rounds with Mike Tyson''.<
Giving the verdict Mr Somjee said: ``I find that the defendant intended the
behaviour to be insulting and was aware that they would be so.<
``I find that the defendant's conduct was intended to be hostile. It was based
on her membership of a racial group. I find him guilty.''<
The court heard evidence from three other police officers who witnessed the
incident but made no reference to it. Only Tracey Jackson, the wife of another
police officer, gave evidence to the court backing Pc Campbell's complaint.<
Mr Somjee said that they were ``deliberately selective'' in what they heard.<
He added: ``It was interesting that of the people who were there the only
person who was prepared to say what they heard was not a police officer.''<
After the verdict Pc Campbell, a mother of two who has been a police officer
since 1993 said: ``It has been a traumatic eight months waiting for this trial
to come and to be dealt with. I'm pleased with the outcome and the support that
I have been given by my colleagues at work. I just hope to get on with my life
and my children and to get on with my work as a police officer.''<
Ferguson had denied using threatening or insulting words or behaviour which
were racially aggravated under Section 5 of the Public Order Act and Section 28
of the Crime and Disorder Act.<
