  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ms Campbell said that when he saw a picture of boxer Mike Tyson, Ferguson, a
police officer since January 1987, told her that she looked as if she ``could
have gone six rounds with Mike Tyson'', and that she replied: ``No, I couldn't,
I have a cute nose.''<
Ms Campbell later then reported the matter to Steve Otter, the Borough
Commander of north Kensington and Chelsea, who was at the quiz night.<
He told Ferguson to modify his behaviour and later referred the matter to the
Central Complaints Bureau.<
The next day Ferguson sought out Ms Campbell at work and apologised to her in
the corridor outside the CID room.<
But she told him that she did not feel his apology was genuine and that she
had already spoken to Mr Otter, who was now considering if any further action
should be taken.<
Mr Richard Atchley, defending, said Ferguson, who has been suspended since the
incident, accepted that he made the comment and gestures but claimed that they
were only intended as ``banter'' between colleagues, said <
Mr Atchley added: ``It was an ill-judged attempt at humour, perhaps
flirtatious, but it was never intended to cause alarm or be racist.''<
