Ferguson, who has been suspended on full pay since the incident, accepted that
he had made the comment but told the court they had been intended as ``banter''
between friendly colleagues.<
The divorced father of two now faces an internal Metropolitan Police tribunal
where his future within the service will be decided.<
After the verdict Steve Otter, Borough Commander for Kensington and Chelsea,
said: ``We dealt with this within a day of it happening which demonstrates our
commitment to not tolerating in any way racist insults or behaviour by any of
our officers.<
``It also shows how firmly we believe in bringing people to justice who do
this.<
``It has been a very traumatic time for Sonia Campbell who has been very
courageous in the evidence she has given and for standing up against this
unacceptable behaviour.''<
After the verdict Insp David Michael, chairman of the Black Police
Association, said: ``As professionally as Mr Otter and his team have dealt with
this there are still many questions unanswered about how the Metropolitan Police
service overall is dealing with overt and institutional racism.''<
He added: ``Unfortunately we will keep getting more and more of these cases
and the confidence of the public in the Metropolitan Police service will
continue to be undermined until the hierarchy there takes a more robust position
on institutionalised racism and how to tackle it.''<
