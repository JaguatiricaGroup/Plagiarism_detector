                14:22 21/06/00: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Campbell
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a statement read out in court Mrs Jackson said: ``For no reason he pushed his
nose down with the forefinger. He kept it depressed for a short time and he said
to Sonia `you are a flat-nosed monkey' there was no response from anyone.''<
An emotional Ferguson told the court that he had drunk at least five pints of
alcohol before the quiz started and that he drank steadily throughout the
evening.<
He was trying to be ``outrageous'' in an attempt to hide his grief because it
was also the anniversary of his father's death, he said.<
Ferguson, who said he had undergone counselling and had now stopped drinking,
said he had drunk so much that he did not remember what he had said.<
He said: ``I was trying to have good time and trying too hard. I did not mean
to insult anybody. I was trying to party.''<
Any racist comments were part of banter between colleagues, he said, adding:
``It was a piece of fun at Sonia as a person, as a colleague, not because she is
coloured. I do not believe that I am a racist.<
``I like Sonia _ she is one of the people I would go out of my way to help.<
``I know that with this incident she is probably still cloudy about me but I
am sorry for what I have done because I hurt somebody that I like.''<
