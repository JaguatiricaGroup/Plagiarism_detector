           17:16 21/06/00: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Campbell Nightlead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier Pc Campbell recalled her alarm when a drunken Ferguson stared at her
across a table and pressed his nose down while ``laughing smugly'' at her. She
said: ``I felt humiliated, insulted. I was the only black person there amongst a
group of white people.<
``I felt embarrassed for them. I did not want to go to this quiz night. A
friend of mine had asked me to go and I thought, what have I done to him to
insult me. I felt very hurt and insulted too.''<
The court was told that Ferguson repeated the nose flattening gesture at least
twice and also told Pc Campbell that she looked like she ``could have gone six
rounds with Mike Tyson''.<
Pc Campbell then reported the matter to Mr Otter who attended the quiz night,
and he later reported it to the Police Complaints Bureau.<
The day after the incident Ferguson apologised to Pc Campbell at work but she
told him the matter was now being considered by Mr Otter and further action
could be taken.<
An emotional Ferguson told the court that he had drunk at least five pints of
alcohol before the quiz and had drank steadily throughout the evening. He said
that he was being ``outrageous'' in an attempt to hide his grief that it was
also the anniversary of his father's death and he genuinely believed that Pc
Campbell would see it as a joke.<
Ferguson, who said he had drunk so much that he could not remember what he
said, told the court: ``It was a piece of fun at Sonia as a person, as a
colleague, not as a coloured person.<
``I do not believe that I am a racist.<
``I like Sonia, she is one of the people I would go out of my way to help.''<
He added: ``I am sorry for what I have done because I have hurt somebody that
I like. He said that he has now stopped drinking and undergone counselling.<
