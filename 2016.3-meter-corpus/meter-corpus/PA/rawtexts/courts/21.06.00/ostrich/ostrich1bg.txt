`GOLDEN EGG' SCAM THAT FOOLED SO MANY<
By Graham Hiscott, PA News<
As with the most ruthlessly executed scams it was the apparent simplicity
coupled with mouth-watering returns that convinced more than 2,700 ordinary
people to invest in the Ostrich Farming Corporation.<
They handed over almost #22 million, but a sizeable chunk ended up in the bank
accounts of the two men at the heart of the operation to fund a luxury
lifestyle.<
When investigators finally caught up with them the company had amassed
liabilities of #70 million and most of the people who entrusted their money to
the pair would never see a penny again.<
The scam was simple. Ostrich meat would be the ``cash crop of the 90s'' and to
satisfy the expected explosion in demand, investors could buy hens whose eggs
would then be sold on.<
With a mature bird capable of laying between 30 and 90 eggs a season, owners
could see a staggering return of up to 2,000% over 10 years.<
In comparison to traditional investments, the scheme appeared a golden egg and
people of all backgrounds and intelligence, including accountants, lawyers and
retired policemen, handed over their money.<
Some bought breeder chicks for as little as #1,400, while others invested up
to #60,000. There are even reports of a small number pouring six-figure sums in
the doomed scheme.<
They were given a microchip number for their own bird and told there was a
guaranteed buy-back scheme.<
The brains behind the operation were former car salesman Allan Walker, 57, and
49-year-old video shop owner, Brian Ketchell, both of Newark, Nottinghamshire.<
National newspapers were used to advertise the product, offering those who
joined the chance to become a member of what was called The Ostrich Owners
Club.<
A contributing factor to people's interest in the scheme was that the company
played on public concern at the time about BSE, claiming ostrich meat - which it
likened in taste and texture to a fillet of beef - would replace 10% of the beef
market in the UK.<
Comparisons were also made with the growth in the salmon farming industry.<
A company brochure boasted that OFC had farms in Belgium with the latest
facilities, including hatchery and nursery care and 50 hectares of outdoor
rearing fields.<
In truth, the two farms, near Ghent, belonged to a company it was purchasing
the birds from.<
Claims were also made of having additional offices through western Europe and
the Middle East - again not true.<
In April 1995 the Department of Trade and Industry's Companies Investigation
Branch carried out checks on the company after concerns it was ``just another
marketing/money generating scheme.''<
However, by that stage there had been no complaints and it was concluded that
there was no need for a more thorough investigation.<
Ironically, a supervisor at the DTI said at the time: ``I hope members of the
club are not burying their heads in the sand over the likely returns they can
earn.''<
Towards the end of 1995 the firm began flying investors aboard a private plane
to see facilities at the farms in Belgium. The ploy proved an instant success
and most who took up the offer agreed to part with their money. <
They also enlisted the services of former ITN news reader Fiona Armstrong who
invested more than #20,000 of her own money and also agreed to present an
18-minute video for the scheme.<
The trial heard her mother became involved and invested #10,000 - which she
also lost.<
In court Miss Armstrong said: ``At the time the newspapers were full of this
thing. It was exciting.''<
The venture was now such a success a ``wall of money'' began flowing into the
business and the company was invited on a Department of Trade and
Industry-funded mission to boost British interests in Saudi Arabia.<
In time a second company, Wall Street Corporation, was set up in Delaware, USA
with an offshore bank account on the Isle of Man to buy ostriches to then sell
back to OFC.<
Two more companies, Jarvis Marketing and Company Administration, were also
formed for similar purposes.<
By now the company was attracting huge amounts of interest. Records show 80%
of the takings came in the last five months it was trading.<
It was only in September 1995 the DTI reopened its file on the company which
concluded with it being wound-up in March the following year.<
Among the reasons the DTI cited for the closure was OFC's ``misleading and
inaccurate'' promotional material, the ``highly speculative and fundamentally
unsound'' nature of the scheme and OFC's inadequate record keeping.<
However, the company's liquidator said the DTI had assembled ``virtually all
the information'' it needed to close OFC by January 1996 and that the
three-month delay cost investors almost #15 million.<
Michael Buckley, the parliamentary ombudsman, after an investigation, cleared
the DTI of maladministration. He also rejected the contention that investors
should be reimbursed by the Government.<
The Serious Fraud Office carried out an extensive four-year investigation
which culminated in the trial at Leicester Crown Court.<
The collapse of the company came as a complete shock to many. Some found they
had been hoodwinked into believing they had bought birds which, it turned out,
never existed.<
The firm said it had 3,456 birds, but in truth 925 of these were simply a
microchip for which unsuspecting owners were still required to pay the livery
costs. <
In an attempt to salvage something from the mess, two companies were set up by
those who had lost money.<
Belatruche used a farm in Belgium, while a second company, Scotia Avian
Farming Enterprise (Safe), was established in Scotland.<
Four years on, and without the promised explosion in demand for ostrich
products, many investors have still to receive a fraction of their outlay.<
