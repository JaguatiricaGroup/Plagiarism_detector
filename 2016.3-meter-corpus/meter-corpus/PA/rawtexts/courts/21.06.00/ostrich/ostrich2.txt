  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two other men, Brian Ketchell, 49, and Allan Walker, 57, both of Newark, Notts -
who originally set the company up and earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
defraud - are due to be sentenced tomorrow.<
The Jones brothers were accused of being heavily involved in the running of
the firm from the summer of 1995, five months after it began trading.<
The cost to the taxpayer of investigating and prosecuting the case was
expected to top #1 million, without the bill for legal aid which all four were
granted.<
The pyramid-style investment promised investors returns of more than 2,000%
for buying birds to fulfil what the company predicted would be an explosion in
demand for ostrich products.<
The trial heard the company used the BSE scare to claim there would be a huge
demand for ostrich meat.<
Through advertisements followed by the offer of visiting an ostrich farm the
company claimed to own in Belgium, investors flocked to hand over their money.<
The Jones brothers were accused of masterminding the marketing side of the
business, after which a ``wall of money'' was said to have come flowing in.<
Fiona Armstrong, who was so taken in she bought two birds for #20,000, even
agreed to appear in a promotional video.<
Many of those who invested - including a bank manager, lawyers and a retired
policeman - thought they creating a nest-egg for their future.<
The company made #22 million pounds in the 15 months it was in business from
January 1995 until April the following year and after its collapse many never
saw a penny of their investment again.<
The scam was eventually exposed by investigators from the Department of Trade
and Industry.<
Russell Jones said after the verdict: ``From the very start I never had any
doubt the jury would return a verdict of not guilty. I am just pleased I can
start to put my life back together.''<
He reiterated that he and his brother never believed OFC was being run
dishonestly, although accepting that they personally received the huge
commissions given in court.<
``What we brought on board was to professionalise the sales team, which we did
very successfully,'' said Mr Jones, who after the collapse of OFC set-up a sales
and marketing business in Geneva, Switzerland.<
The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution after a four-year
investigation, said it was unable to comment until after tomorrow's sentencing.<
