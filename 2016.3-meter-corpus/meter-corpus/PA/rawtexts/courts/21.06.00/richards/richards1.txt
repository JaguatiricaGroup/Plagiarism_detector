ASSAULT CASE WOMAN SEEMED FRIGHTENED, SAYS TAXI DRIVER<
By Robert Westhead, PA News<
A woman who was allegedly punched in the face by former Tory minister seemed
``upset and frightened'' when he called at her flat, a taxi driver told a court
today.<
Welsh Assembly member Rod Richards is accused of attacking Cassandra Melvin
and then hurling her at a car, breaking her elbow.<
Cab driver Ibrahim El-Hoshi told a jury at told Kingston Crown Court that at
first neither Cassandra Melvin nor her sister Tiffini opened the door of the
ground-floor flat when he knocked.<
The young women then ``had a good look at me'' to make sure he was a taxi
driver after he tapped on the window.<
``When they saw me they seemed relieved I was not what they expected,'' he
said.<
The more heavily-built of the two women _ believed to be Cassandra Melvin _
was highly emotional and crying, he said, adding: ``The bigger lady was holding
her arm and she looked like she had a black eye or some injury to her face.''<
Richards, 53, of Heolisaf, Radyr, Cardiff, denies assaulting Cassandra Melvin,
causing her grievous bodily harm, outside Tiffini Melvin's flat in Chilton Road,
Kew, south west London, on July 27 last year.<
Richards, who resigned as leader of the Tories in the Welsh Assembly to fight
the allegations, bought Cassandra Melvin, 23, and her 31-year-old sister dinner
at Pizza Express in Richmond, south west London, asking them if they liked
``older men'', the court has been told.<
The prosecution has said that he then invited himself back to their flat for
coffee, but that Cassandra Melvin showed him the door when they called him a
taxi because he had upset her sister.<
Richards is alleged to have attacked Cassandra Melvin when she then opened the
front door to check that he had gone.<
The sisters have told the jury that when the taxi arrived, they took it to
their mother's home, then travelled to hospital.<
