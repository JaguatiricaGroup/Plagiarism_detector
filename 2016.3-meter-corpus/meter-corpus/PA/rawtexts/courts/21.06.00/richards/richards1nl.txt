EX-TORY MINISTER IN ASSAULT CASE ADMITS CONVICTION FOR VIOLENCE<
By Robert Westhead, PA News<
A former Tory Minister accused of punching a girl in the face today admitted
in court to having a conviction for violence.<
Rod Richards also admitted to a jury at Kingston Crown Court to ``chatting
up'' the blonde and her sister over his favourite pizza.<
He told police after his arrest he had no ``sexual interest'' in the young
women, the court earlier heard.<
Richards, a junior Welsh Office minister under former prime minister John
Major, is accused of punching Cassandra Melvin in the face and fracturing her
elbow, leaving her bruised with a bleeding nose.<
Richards, 53, of Heol Isaf, Radyr, Cardiff, resigned as leader of the Tories
in the Welsh Assembly to fight the allegations.<
He denies assaulting Cassandra Melvin, causing her grievous bodily harm,
outside Tiffini Melvin's flat in Chilton Road, Kew, south west London, on July
27 last year.<
Giving evidence, the Welsh Assembly member said he had been found guilty of
actual bodily harm after punching a fellow cab driver in the face in 1975 during
a fight while he was working at a taxi firm as student during his holidays.<
Richards also admitted he was cautioned by the North Wales Police for not
declaring his conviction in his application for a firearms certificate and a
shotgun certificate.<
The Welsh Assembly member admitted not being totally ``frank'' in his police
interview about the alleged assault on Cassandra Melvin.<
He had denied to police being sexually attracted to the 23-year-old, or her
sister Tiffini, 31, with whom he struck up conversation in a pub in Richmond,
south west London.<
He told the jury: ``Had there been any indication from the girls that they
were interested in a relationship, then I might have had a sexual interest, but
there was no signal at all, which prevented me from pursuing that ...''<
Richards, who has been married for 25 years, said: ``Had there been any
suggestion, there was no reason in my domestic situation why I should not have
pursued that.<
``I was talking to them in a chatty sort of way, a teasingly chatty sort of
way. But there was no suggestion from either of the girls that they were
remotely interested.''<
Richards told the jury he went from Cardiff to London for a business meeting
at Millbank and was not looking for company.<
However, MP Nigel Evans, with whom he was staying, was out late doing at TV
interview.<
So Richards, ``at a loose end'', took a taxi to Richmond where he used to live
and bumped into the strangers and started chatting.<
He went on the Pizza Express where he ordered his favourite pizza, the
American Hot, with extra jalapeno peppers, and had a ``jovial'' time with the
sisters.<
Questioned by Ann Mallalieu QC, defending, he said it was ``pretty foolish''
for a man of his age to chat up two young girls.<
He said the atmosphere suddenly changed after going back to Tiffini Melvin's
flat in Chilton Road, Kew, for coffee.<
Richards said: ``Suddenly, apropos of nothing, the mood suddenly changed.
Cassandra Melvin walked into the living room and said `It's time you were
leaving'.<
``As she was pushing me out, the front door was pushed effectively on my back
and I was in the position of being squeezed out the door.<
``I pushed the door back to make enough space to get out of the door. As I
tried to leave the property I felt a push from behind me.<
``I have to say at this stage I was so relieved to be out that I went as
quickly as I could down the garden path and out the gate.''<
Richards, who told the jury he had never struck a woman, denied attacking
Cassandra Melvin.<
He said he first learned something was wrong when he was alerted by police
about a ``serious incident'' on his mobile phone while driving back to Cardiff.<
Asked why he was not frank to police, he said: ``I was embarrassed at being at
the police station and felt foolish for finding myself in those circumstances
and was worried about Press harassment of my family.''<
Asked why he had not told anyone about the encounter, he said: ``I had been
stupid enough to go there their flat in the first place and not recognise the
danger or the stupidity of it all.''<
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.<
