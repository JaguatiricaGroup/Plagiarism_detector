  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Later the court heard that Richards was on his way to the home of Tory MP Nigel
Evans when he allegedly carried out the attack.<
In a police interview, Richards denied punching and swearing at Cassandra
Melvin and said he did not ``fancy'' either sister.<
He said he was pushed out of their flat after they invited him in for coffee
after they had all had a beer and glass of wine earlier.<
The sisters had joined him for a ``pleasant'' meal at Pizza Express in
Richmond, his favourite restaurant, for which he paid.<
Richards, who said he was ``unfazed'' that the sisters had no money, said he
had been stopping off on his way to Mr Evans's home, near Victoria.<
In an interview read out in court, he said Cassandra Melvin promised to pay
him back if he gave them a lift home.<
Soon after they reached the sisters' flat ``the large-ish girl said its about
time you went'', Richards told police.<
He went on: ``I said `I thought you were going to pay me for the meal'. She
took me by the arm and pushed me towards the door.''<
Richards, who denied hurling abuse at Cassandra Melvin, said she slammed the
door on him before he had actually made his way out.<
``I thought it was a bit heavy-handed, but I was glad to go. Somebody pushed
me down the steps, I thought that was a bit much,'' he said.<
``I stumbled down the steps, turned on my feet and left.<
``I trotted off. I felt it was rather unpleasant and I didn't want to stay
around after that kind of an event, being pushed out of a house.''<
During the interview, with Detective Constable Robert Clarke at Twickenham
police station, he denied having any ``sexual interest'' in the sisters.<
Richards said he neither punched Cassandra Melvin nor hurled her at a car in a
tussle outside her flat, telling Det Con Clarke: ``At no time did I touch her
arm, at no time did I do any of this, it's completely untrue.''<
