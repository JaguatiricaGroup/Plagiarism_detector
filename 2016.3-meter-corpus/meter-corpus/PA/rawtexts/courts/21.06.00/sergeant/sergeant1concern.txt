REPORT WARNED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY POLICE<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
Police watchdogs have become increasingly concerned about the number of
allegations of sexual misconduct made against policemen in recent years.<
The problem was the subject of a detailed report by the Police Complaints
Authority in 1998 _ a year in which more than 30 officers were suspended over
allegations of indecency, indecent assault and rape.<
PCA officials concluded that some policemen displayed an ``outdated and
unacceptable'' attitude towards women and that a few were prepared to ``betray
their position of trust for personal sexual gratification''.<
``Allegations of sexual harassment by police officers have been the subject of
a growing number of cases dealt with by the authority over recent years,'' said
the PCA report.<
``Some involved complaints about the way male officers had treated female
support staff. However most stemmed from accusations that officers had behaved
improperly towards female members of the public.''<
The report added: ``Most complaints from members of the public related to
on-duty officers forcing their attentions on women whom they had met during
routine inquiries.<
``However, the most disturbing came from women whose vulnerability had been
exploited by police officers to whom they turned for help.<
``In some cases, officers had formed sexual relationships with the victims of
domestic violence. In others, women complaining of harassment had sought police
protection only to suffer the same treatment from the officer supposed to be
assisting them.''<
The report concluded: ``Any allegation against a police officer which has
sexual overtones is certain to receive considerable media attention.<
``It is, therefore, important to stress that the number of cases coming to the
authority represent a tiny proportion of our workload.<
``Nevertheless, they do suggest that some male police officers still display
an outdated and unacceptable attitude towards women and that a few are prepared
to betray their position of trust for personal sexual gratification.''<
The authority said one investigation related to a police officer accused of
indecently assaulting a number of women held in cells.<
The officer, who was not identified in the report, was found guilty of
disobedience to force orders by making unauthorised visits to female prisoners.<
It also emerged that complaints had been made against the officer in the
past.<
The investigation raised questions about a lack of supervision by custody
sergeants, to whom the officer was responsible.<
The officer was dismissed from the force after being found guilty of
discreditable conduct.<
An inspector was also admonished and 15 sergeants were warned about failures
in supervision.<
High-profile court cases involving policemen accused of sex offences in recent
years include:<
:: May 1998 _ Pc John Blott, 23, from Redcar, Cleveland, was jailed for 10
years at Leeds Crown Court after being convicted of two rapes and an indecent
assault.<
The court heard that all the attacks took place after Blott, a former
professional footballer with Manchester City and Carlisle United, met women
while working as a beat policeman.<
:: December 1999 _ Acting Sergeant David Carson, 37, of Norwich, was jailed
for four months for indecently assaulting two women officers while on duty.<
The court heard that he touched an officer's leg while talking about sex in a
patrol car at 3am and held another officer's arms above her head, saying: ``I'm
telling you to have sex with me.''<
