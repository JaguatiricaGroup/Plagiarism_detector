18 YEARS FOR SERGEANT WHO RAPED WOMAN IN POLICE CELL<
By Damien Brook and Brian Farmer, PA News<
A ``squalid and sexually depraved'' police sergeant was tonight beginning an
18-year prison sentence after being convicted of raping and indecently
assaulting women while on duty.<
Paul Banfield, 33, a former custody sergeant at Parkside police station,
Cambridge, raped and indecently assaulted young women being held in cells and
raped a 45-year-old divorcee after breaking into her home.<
The Police Complaints Authority said Banfield had bought ``disgrace upon the
police service'' and senior officers said they were reviewing procedures in an
effort to ensure that such crimes could not happen again.<
Detectives believe that other victims may still come forward to complain about
Banfield and have issued a hotline number for women to contact.<
Officers said one woman had called since Banfield's trial began at Nottingham
Crown Court two-and-a-half weeks ago.<
The judge Mr Justice Morland told Banfield: ``You subjected these women to
humiliating and terrifying experiences to satisfy your squalid sexual
depravity.''<
Tom Lloyd, Deputy Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Police, added: ``Banfield
is a sexual predator who used his position of considerable authority and trust
to target and attack women ... He is a dangerous and cunning individual.''<
Banfield, of St Neots, Cambs, denied two rapes, burglary with intent to rape
and indecent assault but was convicted on majority verdicts of all four counts.<
He admitted three indecent assaults on two women.<
