CAREER COP DISGRACED BY SEX ATTACKS<
By Damien Brook, PA News<
Sergeant Paul Banfield grew visibly paler and more gaunt during the course of
his trial.<
But the 33-year-old never lost his bearing, never once slouching, or letting
his attention wander from the proceedings at Nottingham Crown Court.<
Banfield, who now lives in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, first joined the police
service just over 15 years ago, in March 1985.<
The teenage recruit, jailed for 18 years today for rape, indecent assault and
burglary with intent to rape, joined the Metropolitan Police in London and
trained at the force college in Hendon, north London.<
After completing his training the Bedford-born officer was stationed in
fashionable Kensington, central London, where he spent four years as a beat
officer.<
But in 1989 he left the Metropolitan Police and moved to Cambridgeshire.<
He told his trail: ``I did not like working in London, the fumes from the
traffic were affecting my health.''<
At first he was stationed in St Neots, then he transferred to Huntingdon,
where he worked for 18 months.<
He became a community beat officer on the Oxmoor council estate, Huntingdon,
working there for three-and-a-half years.<
Banfield then moved into plain clothes work with the St Neots proactive team
and later the surveillance team based at the force HQ.<
He told the court: ``Then in 1995/6 I took the sergeants' exams and passed
them.<
``I did not want promotion straight away from the proactive unit because I
wanted to work on the surveillance team.''<
He finally went before a promotion board in 1998, and was duly promoted to
sergeant.<
During his 15-year career he had previously been the subject of a single
complaint _ officers have not given details, but it was not upheld and he was
not suspended or put on restrictive duties.<
Banfield is single but has been living with his girlfriend, Tracey, in St
Neots.<
She attended the first day of his trial and has indicated to other members of
the Cambridgeshire force that she will stick by Banfield.<
However, it is also understood that she has signed a deal with a national
newspaper for her story.<
Banfield's parents, Tony and Angela, have attended court every day, sitting in
the back row of the public gallery. Tony Banfield frequently took notes during
the proceedings.<
The couple have refused to comment on the case.<
