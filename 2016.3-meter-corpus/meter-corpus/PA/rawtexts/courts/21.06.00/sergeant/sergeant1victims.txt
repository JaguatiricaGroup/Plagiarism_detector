POLICE FEAR SEX ATTACK SERGEANT HAD MORE VICTIMS<
By Brian Farmer and Damien Brook, PA News<
Detectives fear Sgt Paul Banfield may have been responsible for other sex
attacks.<
They have received a call from one woman since the start of the trial and are
preparing to deal with more complaints in the wake of publicity about the case.<
``That is something we have anticipated as a possibility and we will be making
arrangements to handle calls if they come in,'' said Det Supt Chris Stevenson,
who led the investigation into Banfield.<
``There may be people who have not come forward. We believe one woman in
particular may have some information.<
``One woman rang us on two occasions, once to a hotline number and once
tocrimestoppers.<
``She didn't reveal her identity but provided enough information for officers
to believe she may have been a victim. We know she called from phone box just
outside Huntingdon.<
''We made appeals for her to get in touch again but she failed to make contact
again and remains unknown to inquiry team.''<
The only link between any of Sergeant Paul Banfield's victims was that they
were unfortunate enough to come into contact with him.<
One victim was a 45-year-old divorcee who had her own home, valued her
independence and enjoyed the company of her friends.<
Another was a 20-year-old woman who had been arrested for shoplifting and was
being held in a cell at Parkside police station, under Banfield's care.<
Banfield had denied raping two of his victims while on duty and indecently
assaulting a third, as well as burglary with intent to rape, between September
1998 and October 1999.<
But before the start of his trial at Nottingham Crown Court, he admitted
having indecently assaulted two other women.<
The jury at his trial heard how Banfield made advances _ some clumsy, some
more subtle _ to his victims, none of whom can be named for legal reasons.<
When his approaches were rejected, he launched his attacks.<
His first victim, known at the trial as Woman B, who at the time lived in a
village near Cambridge, was attacked after going out for an evening with friends
in September 1998.<
She told the court that at the end of the evening, she approached Banfield as
he sat in a police van in the Market Square, Cambridge, and told him she had
been burgled in the past and was not happy with the police response.<
He said he would look into it and she gave her details.<
Hours later, Banfield broke into her home _ using the same small toilet window
the burglars had used _ and raped her.<
Banfield told the jury he had been invited for a cup of tea, but arrived to
see, through a front window, Woman B slumped on the sofa.<
``I was concerned that she may have tried to harm herself as I could see an
upturned portrait, a bottle of alcohol and a bottle of medication on the coffee
table in front of her,'' he said.<
He made repeated attempts to ring her, then broke in because he was concerned
about her safety.<
But Woman B said she had gone to sleep on the sofa, but woke in her bed to
find Banfield raping her. She could even hear his police radio crackling.<
After the attack, Banfield dressed and left through the front door without
saying a word, she said.<
He said the sex was consensual after he had awoken the woman and they had
chatted for a while.<
The woman spoke to police shortly afterwards but did not pursue the complaint
because she was ``scared''. But she went back to the police a year later after
learning that Banfield was suspected of another attack.<
His second victim, Woman C, a 28-year-old who worked for the Crown Prosecution
Service, said she was indecently assaulted by the officer.<
She met Banfield five years earlier and they had a one-night-stand.<
He called her at work, saying it would be nice to see her again. By this time
she had a long-term partner, who was out of the country.<
Banfield insisted he just wanted to meet for a chat over coffee and Woman C
finally agreed he could visit her at her new flat while she was on her lunch
break.<
At first he was pleasant and chatty, but as she showed him around the flat he
then began to kiss her and ``shuffled'' her backwards into the bedroom, she
said.<
He then indecently assaulted her _ continuing to do so even when she answered
the phone to her mother.<
Banfield admitted that in September 1999 he indecently assaulted Woman F, and
in October 1999 indecently assaulted Woman D, while apparently comforting them
in the cells at Parkside police station.<
He repeatedly visited 20-year-old Woman F, who had been arrested for
shoplifting, in her cell before grabbing her and indecently assaulting her.<
Following her release he visited her home, gave her flowers and even told her
he loved her. Only her boyfriend's intervention finally stopped him.<
Describing his reaction when his advances were spurned Woman F said: ``He was
shouting at me `what's wrong with me?' and the veins were popping out of his
head with anger.''<
Banfield visited Woman D, a single 24-year-old, numerous times in her cell
after she was arrested for being drunk and disorderly.<
Banfield went to her cell to reassure her she would be released with just a
caution, but indecently assaulted her during one visit when she was being sick.<
The final attack came just a few days later when Banfield raped Woman A after
she was arrested for failing to appear at court.<
The 26-year-old had gone to the police station to take some possessions to her
boyfriend and was arrested when she got there.<
Banfield visited her cell numerous times and when she asked for a white paper
boiler suit _ so she would not have to sleep in her own clothes while in custody
_ he told her she should leave it unzipped and take off her underwear.<
Banfield then went into her cell with his trousers unzipped and began fondling
her, then raped her.<
Woman A made notes of the attack and kept them hidden under the mattress in
the cell.<
Banfield denied attacking Woman A and CCTV video of the night in question,
which showed the cell block area, had vanished.<
But subsequent tapes showed Banfield mopping out the cell Woman A had been
occupied, and disposing of blankets she had been using.<
Woman A told the court: ``He gave me a white boiler suit to change into but
told me to take off my underwear and keep the suit unzipped.<
``I didn't say anything. I was really shocked.''<
Describing the rape, she added: ``I wanted to scream but nothing was coming
out because I was just so scared. He said that if I said anything he would lose
his job.''<
