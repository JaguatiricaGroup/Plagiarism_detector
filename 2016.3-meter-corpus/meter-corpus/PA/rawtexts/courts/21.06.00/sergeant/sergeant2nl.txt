The PCA said all police forces must consider ensuring that every custody suite
had at least one woman on duty.<
``This officer (Banfield) has bought disgrace upon the police service,'' said
acting PCA chairman Molly Meacher.<
``He has let down the police force and the women that he was sworn to
protect.<
``Women must be able to feel safe in custody ... The police service will need
to review whether every custody suite should have at least one woman officer or
civilian on duty.''<
Mr Lloyd said he would conduct a ``thorough investigation'' to review ``every
aspect'' of custody procedures within the force.<
He also said he was ``gravely concerned'' because proper procedures had not
been followed when officers were investigating an informal complaint made about
Banfield a year before his crimes came to light.<
But he did not believe that Banfield's colleagues had deliberately or
consciously protected Banfield or tried to cover his crimes.<
Banfield will be dismissed from the police. No other officer has faced any
form of disciplinary action as a result of the case.<
Northamptonshire police carried out an investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the Banfield investigation and made a list of recommendations.<
One of those was that audio recording equipment should be installed in police
custody suites as well as video cameras in an attempt to pick up any
inappropriate remarks made to women prisoners.<
Mr Lloyd said he was also considering installing cameras in cells but stressed
that such a move could affect prisoners' privacy rights.<
The PCA has already pressed for the extension of closed circuit television
cameras in custody areas.<
