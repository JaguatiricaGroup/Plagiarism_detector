Police launched an investigation in October last year after a 26-year-old woman
being held in cells at Parkside complained that Banfield had raped her.<
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons and was referred to as Woman
A, said Banfield had made repeated visits to her cells and unzipped the white
paper boiler suit she was wearing before raping her.<
Checks revealed that a year earlier, a 45-year-old divorcee, known as Woman B,
had claimed that she had been raped by Banfield but had refused to make a formal
complaint.<
She said she had chatted to Banfield late one night while he was on duty in
the centre of Cambridge. The woman had given him her address after saying she
had been burgled a few months before and was unhappy with police.<
Banfield was said to have followed her home, broken in through an insecure
toilet window and raped her.<
When questioned about the incident by officers investigating the attack on
Woman A, Woman B agreed to make a formal complaint.<
Detectives then discovered that a file containing details of a police
interview with her at the time of the attack was missing.<
It also emerged that on the night of the attack, Banfield had asked a
colleague to cover for him, saying he was ``visiting a friend'', and that he had
failed to answer a radio call for help from a constable.<
Mr Lloyd said he would ask the PCA to supervise a separate investigation into
the circumstances surrounding the missing file.<
Further checks with prisoners who had been in Banfield's care unearthed two
more women who had been indecently assaulted by the sergeant in cells at
Parkside.<
Two other women also came forward to make complaints. One, a woman who was
briefly involved with Banfield years earlier, said the officer had indecently
assaulted her at her home.<
The second, also an acquaintance of Banfield's, said she was ``forcefully
kissed'' at her place of work. A charge relating to that incident was left to
``lie on file''.<
Banfield was also arrested on suspicion of stealing a video tape which covered
the custody suite at Parkside on the night he raped Woman A but was never
charged with an offence.<
