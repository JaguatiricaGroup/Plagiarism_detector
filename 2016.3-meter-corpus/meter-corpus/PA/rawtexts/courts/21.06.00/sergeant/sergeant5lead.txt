  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cambridgeshire Deputy Chief Constable Tom Lloyd said after the trial: ``The
investigation into the allegations made against Sergeant Banfield and the
evidence given during his trial have raised important issues for Cambridgeshire
Constabulary, for the public of Cambridgeshire and beyond.''<
He added: ``Firstly, I want to say a few words about Banfield's victims. They
have suffered appalling experiences, have shown strength of character and had
the courage to attend court and to give their evidence. To them I offer my
sincerest apologies on behalf of Cambridgeshire Constabulary.''<
Mr Lloyd said that during the course of the investigation officers became
aware that there may be other women who Banfield had assaulted.<
Because of this his DNA was sent off for testing and cross-referred nationally
to see if it matched any other crime scene - the results were negative.<
Banfield was also profiled by the National Crime Faculty at the Police Staff
College, Bramshill, to see if there were any outstanding cases in the country
but again this proved negative.<
