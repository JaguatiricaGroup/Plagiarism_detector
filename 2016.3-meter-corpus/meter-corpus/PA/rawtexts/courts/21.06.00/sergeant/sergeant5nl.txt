Senior officers said there were no major signals which could have forewarned
anyone about Banfield's crimes.<
About five years ago, a civilian woman had complained that Banfield had made
``sexually inappropriate'' remarks to her during a telephone conversation.<
An inquiry under the auspices of the PCA was launched and Banfield was
interviewed.<
But the PCA recommended that no action should be taken and Banfield was not
disciplined.<
Male and female colleagues of Banfield also told detectives investigating the
rapes that they were unhappy with some of the things he had said to women
colleagues and prisoners.<
Friends also said Banfield would boast of his sexual conquests and point out
women in pubs whom he claimed to have slept with.<
But Mr Lloyd said it was hard to spot any one incident that could have been
acted upon to prevent Banfield's crimes.<
``Banfield is not a symptom of inadequate procedures,'' said Mr Lloyd. ``He is
a man who chose to commit these crimes. Where we can tighten procedures
obviously we have and will continue to seek do so.<
``It is inappropriate and impossible to supervise staff 24 hours a day. We
operate on trust and in the vast majority of cases that trust is well
founded.''<
Banfield, a police officer for 15 years, joined Cambridgeshire police in 1989
after starting his career in the Metropolitan Police.<
He lives with a civilian administration clerk who works for Cambridgeshire
police.<
Banfield told the court his victims had made advances to him, adding: ``I was
very surprised when I was told to go and see the inspector, that I was being
suspended and that all my uniform was being seized for forensic testing.''<
He admitted lying in police interviews, saying: ``I didn't want to admit that
I had done wrong. In the case of the three assaults I have admitted, I feel I
can only apologise.''<
His parents, Tony and Angela, sat at the back of the court throughout the
trial. After Banfield was sentenced they were led away and refused to talk to
reporters.<
