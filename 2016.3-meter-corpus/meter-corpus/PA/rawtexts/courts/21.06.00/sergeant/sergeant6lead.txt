Mr Lloyd added however: ``One woman did ring the inquiry team on two occasions.
On each occasion she declined to reveal her identity but did provide enough
information for officers to believe she may have been a victim of Banfield.<
``It is thought she lived in the Huntingdon area, and with the help of a
carefully worded press release in January this year it was hoped the woman would
call again.''<
But she has not and officers are still appealing for her or any other women
who think they may have been attacked by Banfield to get in touch on a special
hotline number available 24 hours a day. The number is 01733 564 623.<
Mr Lloyd said it had become apparent during the trial that there had been
serious lapses in police procedures.<
``This causes me concern and I intend to conduct a thorough investigation to
review every aspect of custody procedures.<
``At any given moment during a 24-hour period, the custody suite will be
staffed by a minimum of one custody sergeant, a civilian jailer and a police
constable.<
``The sergeant is fully occupied for the vast majority of his or her eight
hour shift and is frequently under the observation of a range of police officers
and representatives of other agencies.''<
He said there was also a duty inspector on 24 hours a day who spent a large
amount of their time in the custody suite.<
And there were unscheduled and unannounced visits made by a panel of lay
visitors to check on conditions.<
Closed circuit TV cameras are in operation in the custody suite. The only
areas uncovered are within the cells themselves.<
Mr Lloyd said: ``No criticism has been made of the positioning or number of
cameras within the cell block.<
``Earlier this year we asked a senior investigating officer from
Northamptonshire Police to carry out a review of our investigation into Banfield
- this is standard practice.<
``The report from Northamptonshire has now been received and we have read it
with interest. Some of the recommendations refer to the way in which we have
used HOLMES (the police computer) during this inquiry and to the use of audio
and visual recording equipment in police stations.''<
