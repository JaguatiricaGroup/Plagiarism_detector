Mr Lloyd said changes had already been made to the way CCTV tapes of the custody
suite were dealt with.<
During the trial the jury was told how a tape which should have shown the
period during which Woman A was raped appeared to have been swapped for a blank
one.<
Mr Lloyd said: ``When an investigation into her allegation of rape first began
officers inspected the tape store and found the relevant tape was missing - that
tape has never been found.<
``An internal review was carried out and as a result tape handling procedures
have been reviewed and several changes made to eradicate the possibility of CCTV
tape contamination.''<
All the tapes are now kept in a locked cabinet.<
Mr Lloyd also said there had been concerns raised at the trial about how
Banfield was able to leave his beat, drive five miles north of Cambridge, and
rape Woman B.<
``It is obvious Banfield lied about his movements when recording these with
the command and control operator,'' said Mr Lloyd.<
He added: ``It is difficult to see how procedural changes could have prevented
Banfield from deserting his post as a patrol sergeant and lying.''<
He described Banfield as ``a sexual predator who used his position of
considerable authority and trust to target and attack women who, for various
reasons, were in a vulnerable position.<
``Thanks to the courage of those women, and the determination of the
investigation team, he is now behind bars.''<
He added: ``Banfield is not a symptom of inadequate procedures, he is a man
who chose to commit these crimes.<
``We operate on trust and in the vast majority of cases that trust is well
founded - there is no evidence to suggest he was protected by his fellow
officers.<
``Banfield used his position as a police officer to attack women in a way
which was likely to be unobserved, and he did all he could to persuade them if
they spoke out they would not be believed.<
``He is a dangerous and cunning individual, but today he is starting a lengthy
sentence for his crimes.''<
