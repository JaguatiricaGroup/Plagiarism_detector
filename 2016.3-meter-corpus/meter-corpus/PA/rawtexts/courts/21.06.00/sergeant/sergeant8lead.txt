Norman Brennan, director of the Victims of Crime Trust and a serving police
officer, said: ``Sergeant Paul Banfield has tarnished the reputation of the
service and brought shame on himself and his family.<
``It is wholly appropriate that he should receive a very long prison sentence
which reflects the serious nature of his crimes and protects women, for whom he
is without a doubt a danger.<
``On behalf of all my colleagues I would like to reassure women that rape is
taken very seriously by the police.''<
