  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Judge Peter Jacobs told Brushett he had ``had an opportunity to do untold
good'' and give the boys in his care his support.<
But he added: ``Instead of giving them that guidance and understanding you
abused them.<
``Your behaviour towards them was cruel and inconsistent.''<
The judge said many of the acts carried out on the boys were designed to
``destroy their personal dignity'' and humiliate them.<
Before discharging the jury, he also criticised the authority's charged with
checking what went on at Bryn-y-Don, in Dinas Powys.<
He said: ``The prosecution in opening this case referred to the complete lack
of supervision of the defendant and the lack of any system of inspection or
control of these premises.<
``That has proved abundantly to be so.''<
As he was led away from the dock, Brushett turned to the judge and said he had
hoped ``the truth would come out, but it hadn't.''<
