                  14:48 22/11/99: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Abuse
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the seven-week trial, prosecutor Christopher Llewellyn-Jones QC told the
court that the offences took place between 1974 and 1980.<
He said Brushett had ``abused his power and his position as headmaster'' for
the six years he was in charge at Bryn-y-Don School.<
The court heard how Brushett, a married father-of-four, would cane the boys
across their bare buttocks and even had names for the canes he used.<
Mr Llewellyn-Jones said Brushett, who was educated at Durham University, would
``thrash'' the boys leaving them bruised and bleeding.<
``It is almost as if he gained some gratification from inflicting pain,''
theprosecutor said.<
Brushett also carried out other acts of physical and sexual abuse on boys at
Bryn-y-Don, a council-run school which had a number of problem children.<
He indecently assaulted some boys by touching their private parts and locked
others naked in the sick bay.<
In one case, he engaged in a ``degrading ritual'' in which boot polish and
lard were smeared over a naked boy, the court heard.<
The offences were said to have mostly taken place in Brushett's home adjoining
the school, in his study or in the sick bay.<
In total, the defendant was found guilty of 18 counts of indecent assaults,
five charges of child cruelty, two counts of actual bodily harm, one count of
attempting a serious sexual assault and one count of carrying out a serious
sexual assault.<
The jury found him not guilty of 13 charges - nine counts of indecent assault,
one charge of actual bodily harm, two counts of child cruelty and one charge of
carrying out a serious sexual assault.<
Earlier in the hearing, the judge ordered that Brushett - who denied all the
charges - should be found not guilty of four other charges.<
Diana Cotton QC, defending, told the jury of six men and six women that school
``folklore and rumour'' could have led the complainants to exaggerate or distort
the truth.<
She reminded the court that all the complainants had criminal records and a
number of them had put in compensation claims.<
