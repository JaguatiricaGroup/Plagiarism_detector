I DID NOT KILL BABIES, INSISTS MUM<
By Mark Benattar, PA News<
Convicted child killer Sally Clark told today of her shock and disbelief at
her conviction for murdering her two babies.<
Clark, who will be sentenced for the murders on Friday at Chester Crown Court,
told in a letter to the pressure group the Portia Campaign, how she was
horrified by comments during the trial.<
The solicitor from South Oak Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, was convicted on a 10-2
majority verdict earlier this month of smothering 11-week-old Christopher in
December 1996 and smothering or shaking Harry aged only eight weeks in January
last year.<
But in a letter to the Cumbrian-based group, who campaign for those they
believe have been wrongly convicted, she tells of her love of her two boys.<
She said: ``I am still in a state of shock and disbelief, as are my legal
team, family and friends. I loved my two little boys and did not harm them in
any way.<
``We have all been horrified by the comments made by both the prosecution and
the press. As a mother and a lawyer I found the prosecution evidence both
inaccurate and inconsistent.''<
She added that apart from Professor Roy Meadow, even the prosecution witnesses
said that they put the causes of death down as ``unascertained''.<
Mr Meadow, a expert in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, told the court the
chances of two infants dying of SIDS in such an affluent family were 73 million
to one.<
She added: ``Whilst I knew a guilty verdict was a possibility  I had to put it
in the back of my mind on the basis that the truth would prevail.<
``Even now I cannot understand how and why I was convicted.<
``I would not wish to harm anyone but I hope that Professor Meadow can sleep
soundly knowing what he has done to Stephen and myself.''<
Both Clark's babies had shown signs of previous physical abuse including brain
damage and broken ribs, but she has always denied ever harming her babies.<
The jury discovered after the case that the policeman's daughter originally
from Devizes, Wiltshire, was an alcoholic who had bought eight bottles of wine
before Harry's death in their luxury home.<
They were also unaware Clark had become pregnant within weeks of Harry's
murder and the baby boy is now in care.<
But in a letter to the British Medical Journal the Portia Campaign say the
odds of the third baby dying would be one in billions, described by the group as
``a little unreasonable''.<
Chairman of Portia Ken Norman said: ``I argue that if there is a genetic flaw
responsible for some types of cot death and this is so malignant as to produce
certain death, then however many babies a couple have, every one of them would
die.''<
He added: ``Two jurors did not agree to convict Mrs Clark, suppose one more
had joined them. She would have gone home, been reunited with the infant and be
giving it tears of joy, kisses and tremendous love.''<
