The jury in the trial of businessman John Taft, accused of the 16-year-old
murder of ``beauty in the bath'' Cynthia Bolshaw, retired today to consider its
verdict.<
The panel of eight women and four men retired at 12.55 pm following the
summing up by Judge David Clarke QC, Recorder of Liverpool.<
Company director Taft, of Borough Road, Birkenhead, Merseyside, denies
murdering Christian Dior beauty consultant Cynthia Bolshaw in October 1983.<
The badly bruised body of Mrs Bolshaw, 50 _ the court has heard that she kept
diaries containing the names of 400 men _ was found naked and face down in the
bath at her bungalow in Buffs Lane, Heswall, Merseyside.<
The jury at Liverpool Crown Court was told Taft admitted having had an
adulterous affair with divorcee Mrs Bolshaw, but denied strangling her and
dumping her body in the bath.<
