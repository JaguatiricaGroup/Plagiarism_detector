JUDGE TAKES PITY ON FRANTIC FATHER WHO STOLE<
By Melvyn Howe, PA News<
A frantic father who stole a six-figure fortune from his solicitor employers
to help his ailing daughter walked free from court today after winning a judge's
sympathy.<
Office manager Paul Hyams, 43, effectively paid himself twice with a string of
duplicated cheques, before committing further thefts.<
By the time his systematic betrayal was discovered, central London law firm
Hughmans and Company was #101,000 the poorer.<
But just months later, conscience-stricken Hyams _ who admitted 16 offences of
deception and asked for 31 others to be considered _ sold his family home and
disposed of other assets to pay back every penny plus interest, London's
Southwark Crown Court heard.<
Suspending an 18-month prison sentence for two years and imposing a 24-month
supervision order, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC, said it was clear that Hyams's
many burdens went a long way toward explaining his 14-month crime spree between
late 1996 and early 1998. <
Those burdens were ``very telling'', amounted to substantial mitigation, and
made the case far from ordinary.<
First and foremost was the fact that his 13-year-old daughter, stricken with
learning difficulties and various health problems, needed treatment and special
tuition.<
The family's finances were pushed even further towards breaking point when a
bereavement left Hyams with the responsibility of caring for his nephew.<
On top of that neither Hyams, of Broadhurst Avenue, Edgware, north London, nor
his wife were in the best of health, said the judge.<
``Whilst this cannot possibly excuse your conduct, this does to some
considerable extent explain how it came about,'' said the judge, who was sitting
with two magistrates.<
``We have had to give intense consideration to the appropriate punishment.
Plainly a sentence of imprisonment is necessary to mark the seriousness of your
offending.<
``What makes this case exceptional, and allows us to suspend that sentence, is
the combination of all the circumstances to which we have referred.''<
