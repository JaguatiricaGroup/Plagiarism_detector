England rugby star Jeremy Guscott attacked a pedestrian, breaking his ankle,
during a road rage incident, a court was told today.<
Guscott, 34, slammed antiques dealer Ken Jones against a doorway to ``teach
him a lesson'' after an incident involving his Mercedes sports car in Bath City
centre on March 24, Bristol Crown Court was told.<
The Bath player denies causing actual bodily harm to 47-year-old Mr Jones.<
Opening the case for the prosecution, Miss Susan Evans said: ``On a Wednesday
afternoon last March a pedestrian was about to cross the road at a crossing in
Bath.<
``There was a car approaching that crossing but the pedestrian stepped out
because the light was red against the car.<
``Instead of stopping, the car continued onto the crossing passing very close
to the pedestrian.<
``The pedestrian knocked on the driver's window. He was angry, at which point
the car stopped and the driver got out of the car.<
``The driver grabbed the pedestrian and physically propelled him across the
road onto the pavement and into a doorway.<
``He slammed the pedestrian into the doorway a number of times.<
''The driver was shouting at the pedestrian as he did so.<
``The pedestrian slumped to the floor.<
``He sustained a badly broken ankle at some time after the driver grabbed hold
of him.<
``The pedestrian was a man called Kenneth Jones.<
``The driver of the car was a man called Jeremy Guscott.''<
Guscott, wearing a light grey suit, light blue shirt and blue tie, originally
faced a charge of causing grievous bodily harm  which was amended to actual
bodily harm today.<
