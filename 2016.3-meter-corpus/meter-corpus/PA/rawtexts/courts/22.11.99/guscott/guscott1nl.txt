GUSCOTT `BROKE PEDESTRIAN'S ANKLE IN ROAD RAGE ATTACK'<
By Dave Higgens and Sarah Westcott, PA News.<
International rugby star Jeremy Guscott broke an antique dealer's ankle when
he repeatedly slammed him into a shop doorway during a road rage incident, a
court heard today.<
Kenneth Jones said the 34-year-old England international told him he was lucky
he had not ``punched his lights out'' during the attack.<
Guscott denies causing Mr Jones actual bodily harm in the incident in Bath on
March 24 this year.<
Giving evidence today at Bristol Crown Court, Mr Jones said he walking across
a pedestrian crossing between his two antiques shops when Guscott's blue
Mercedes sports car approached him as the traffic lights were red.<
He told the jury of nine women and three men: ``I got about half way across
when I felt this car just go flying behind me.<
``It seemed to screech to a halt.<
``I went over to slap on the window of the driver's side.<
``I said 'oy' and that was as far as I got.<
``I intended to say 'you went through a red light' but I do not remember
whether I said it or not as the next thing I knew I was being grabbed by the
defendant.<
``I just felt him grab me by the lapels.<
``I was bundled back onto the pavement and then banged up and down on the
floor.''<
Mr Jones added: ``My legs were on the ground but my body was being lifted.''<
He said Guscott continued to manhandle him against the shop front while
shouting and swearing at him.<
Mr Jones added: ``He said: `Don't take liberties with me'.<
``I said: `But you went though a red light'.<
``He said: `Never walk out in front of my car like that'.<
``I said: `Why are you doing this?'<
``He said,: `You're lucky I didn't punch your lights out'.<
``He was very angry.''<
Mr Jones said he noticed his right foot was at right angles to the pavement.<
``I said: `You've broken my ankle'<
``He said: `Don't be stupid, it's only dislocated'.''<
Mr Jones said he called for help from his shop and his partner called for an
ambulance.<
He was taken to hospital and was told he had three or four broken bones in his
ankle.<
He said he had to have an operation and was in hospital for 11 days.<
Guscott, wearing a light grey designer suit, light blue shirt and blue tie,
spoke only once to confirm his name and sat expressionless throughout the
evidence.<
Opening the case for the prosecution, Miss Susan Evans told the jury, ``I
expect you have all heard of Mr Guscott.<
``You probably know something of his achievements.<
``You probably know he represented his country at the highest level in rugby.<
``I am sure it won't give anyone any pleasure to convict Mr Guscott of this
offence but you have to put aside any emotions you may have.''<
She told the jury Guscott would claim he was acting in self defence.<
``The prosecution say this was not self defence at all.<
``Mr Jones did not represent a threat to Mr Guscott.<
``Mr Guscott was angry Mr Jones had the audacity to step out in front of his
car and knock on the window.<
``He was effectively teaching Mr Jones a lesson.''<
The jury was shown a three-minute video of the incident taken from a camera
inside Mr Jones' shop.<
Guscott won 65 games for England before retiring from international rugby last
year.<
Judge Simon Darwall-Smith adjourned the case until tomorrow when Mr Jones will
be cross-examined by Sally Bennett-Jenkins, defending.<
