  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miss Evans said Guscott maintains he was acting in self defence.<
But she added: ``Mr Jones did not represent a threat to Mr Guscott.<
``Mr Guscott was angry with Mr Jones as he had the audacity to step out in
front of his car and knock on his window.<
``He was effectively teaching Mr Jones a lesson.''<
She told the jury: ``I expect you have all heard of Mr Guscott.<
``You probably know something of his achievements. You probably know he has
represented this country at the highest level in rugby.<
``I'm sure it won't give anyone any pleasure to convict Mr Guscott of this
offence.<
``But you have to put aside any emotions you may have.''<
Guscott, who lives in Bath, won 65 caps for England and scored 30 tries -
putting him second in the all-time list after Rory Underwood.<
He has also taken part in three British Lions tours, scoring a series-winning
dropped goal in Durban, South Africa, two years ago.<
