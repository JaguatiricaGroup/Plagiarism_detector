              16:27 22/11/99: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Guscott Lead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miss Evans said Guscott can be heard on a video camera asking a ``shaken'' Mr
Jones: ``Why did you make me use my brake?''<
The jury heard Mr Jones's ankle was broken and he spent 11 days in hospital.<
Miss Evans showed the jury a number of colour photos of Fountain Antiques and
the surround area of Bath where the alleged offence took place.<
She said: ``You might wonder why you are looking at a picture of an antique
shop here.<
``That's the doorway the Crown says Mr Jones was slammed into by Mr
Guscott.''<
Miss Evans told the jury they would see an ``enhanced video by experts on
behalf of the defence.<
``It's fairly bad quality but you can see something of the incident that takes
place on the crossing,'' she said. ``More interestingly, the video has a
soundtrack and you can hear parts of what is being said, particularly by Mr
Guscott.<
``The Crown suggest you can hear and see the aggression that Mr Guscott is
employing as he deals with Mr Jones.<
``It's a very fast incident, it's seconds, rather than minutes, and Mr Jones
is grabbed very quickly.''<
She said Mr Jones is the owner of Fountain Antiques.<
``He is an averagely-sized individual about 5ft 9ins and weighs about 11
stones.<
``At about 4.30 that day he was about to cross the road at the crossing and he
waits there for a number of seconds.<
``He has got a ball of string in his hand.<
``As he is standing at the crossing there is a blue Mercedes approaching.<
``The lights are on red at the crossing so Mr Jones begins to cross. He is
part way across the crossing when the Mercedes comes past him very close having
failed to stop.<
``The Mercedes then stops because there was a line of traffic.<
``Mr Jones was pretty shaken by having a vehicle that close to him,'' Miss
Evans told the jury.<
She said: ``Mr Jones knocked on the window while holding the ball of string
and said Mr Guscott had later said he thought `it was a rock'.''<
She went on: ``Mr Guscott got out of the car. He was later to tell the police
the reason is because he was worried he had hit him, but once he got out you can
hear the words.<
``He grabs Mr Jones and tells him `Not to take liberties' and `Why did you
make me use my brakes?'''<
She said Mr Guscott later said he felt threatened by Mr Jones and had tried to
``calm him down by walking Mr Jones to the pavement''.<
Miss Evans said: ``He seemed to push him in a fairly aggressive manner.<
``Mr Jones slumped to the floor and he then told Mr Guscott his ankle was
broken.''<
Guscott was ``dismissive'', it was ``only a dislocation'', she said.<
Miss Evans said: ``Mr Guscott clearly realised he had been recognised.''<
She said one witness was ``frightened Mr Guscott might turn on him'' and
``another woman was so concerned she called the police''.<
``Police spoke to Mr Guscott at that time. For a man who claims he had acted
in self defence Mr Guscott wanted to talk to Mr Jones and said he was willing to
pay him compensation,'' she said.<
The court heard Mr Guscott was arrested the next day at his home address and
provided a written statement to the police.<
The jury then attempted to watch a video from the security camera but the
equipment didn't work.<
