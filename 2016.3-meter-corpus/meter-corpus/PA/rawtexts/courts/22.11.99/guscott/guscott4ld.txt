Miss Evans concluded her opening statement by showing the jury a three minute
video recording of the incident which was shot from inside Mr Jones' shop.<
The screens could not be seen from the public gallery.<
Later Mr Jones told the jury he was crossing the road between the two antique
shops he runs after collecting a ball of string, when the incident began.<
He said he crossed the road several times a day and it was always busy.<
Mr Jones said: ``I got about half way across when I felt this car just going
flying behind me.<
``It seemed to sort of screech to a halt behind the crossing.<
``I went over to slap on the window on the driver's side.<
``I said: `Oy' and that was as far as I got.<
``I was frightened and upset.<
``I intended to say: 'You went through a red light,' only I don't remember
whether I said it or not as the next thing I knew I was being grabbed by the
defendant.<
``He was in the driver's seat and because I was close to the car I didn't see
him get out, I just felt him grab me by the lapels of my waistcoat.<
``His grip was strong enough to push me backwards.<
``I was bundled back onto the pavement and then banged up and down on the
floor.<
``I don't really remember a great deal between the shouting and being down on
the floor.<
``Something was being said but I don't remember the exact words. I was very
angry.<
``He continued to lift me up and down.<
``Then I remember him swearing and shouting.<
``He still had hold of my waistcoat.<
``My legs were on the ground but my body was being lifted. It's never happened
to me before.''<
