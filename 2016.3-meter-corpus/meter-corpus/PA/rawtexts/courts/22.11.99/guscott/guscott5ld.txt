Mr Jones continued: ``He pushed me onto the floor and continued to bang me
against the window.<
``He said: 'Don't take liberties with me'.<
``I said: `But you went through a red light'. He said `Never walk in front of
my car like that'<
``I said: `Why are you doing this?'<
``He said `You're lucky I don't punch your lights out'.''<
Mr Jones added he was very angry.<
``I looked down and saw my foot. Where I was sitting with both legs forward my
right foot was at right angles to the pavement.<
``I said: `You've broken my ankle'.<
``He said: `Don't be stupid, it's only dislocated'.<
``I think he realised that he had injured my ankle.<
``He walked away and I thought he was going to get in his car and drive off.<
``I started banging on the railings of the shop and shouting inside to say I'd
been attacked and to take the car's number.''<
Mr Jones said he was trying to talk to his partner, Maggie. He said the woman
then went to talk to Guscott.<
``She asked him his name and I think she ran in and called for an
ambulance.''<
He said Guscott then sat on a chair which was for sale outside the antiques
shop.<
He said: ``I don't remember the exact words, but it was along the lines of
`You should not walk out in front of cars'.<
``He said: `What if my brakes had failed?'<
``I did not know what to say.''<
Mr Jones said he was taken to the Royal United Hospital in Bath where it was
found he had three or four broken bones in his ankle.<
He had to have an operation and was in hospital for 11 days.<
