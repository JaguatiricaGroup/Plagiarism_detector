AL FAYED SHOW HAS HIGH COURT ENTHRALLED<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed is set to enthral the High Court with his
uninhibited views on the world and its ways for much of the week ahead.<
It is thought that Desmond Browne QC, for Neil Hamilton, could take up to five
days over his cross-examination of the 67-year-old businessman, who is fighting
the former MP's libel action over the cash for questions affair.<
After two hours of questioning by his own QC, George Carman, during which Mr
Al Fayed hazarded the opinion that Mr Hamilton would sell his mother for money,
Mr Browne took the bull by the horns and quizzed him on his integrity.<
If he had hoped to rock Mr Al Fayed on his heels and stem the eloquence which
has already resulted in soliloquies worthy of Hamlet, he was wrong.<
``I have the integrity to be anything'', said Mr Al Fayed with the sweeping
assurance of a man once dubbed the Fabulous Pharoah.<
The long list of his achievements that followed _ from recreating the grandeur
of the Duke of Windsor's Paris home to restoring the glory of Fulham's Craven
Cottage _ swept through tiny airless Court 13.<
The pride and the power of the man was evident in his dismissal of any
question from his opponent's lawyers that left him cold.<
Had he once sued Vanity Fair for libel? asked Mr Browne.<
``It's irrelevant'', replied Mr Al Fayed with a wave of his hand.<
Why sue that magazine rather than others which had written unflatteringly of
him? asked Mr Browne.<
``Because I fancied suing them,'' came the withering reply.<
Mr Hamilton, who held Tatton in Cheshire for the Conservatives, is suing Mr Al
Fayed over a January 1997 Channel 4 Dispatches programme.<
Mr Al Fayed alleged in the programme that Mr Hamilton had corruptly demanded
and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz
in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods.<
Mr Al Fayed denies libel and pleads justification.<
Mr Hamilton, still in his lucky grey suit unless he has a wardrobe of
identical garments, could only sit tight-lipped alongside his stern-faced wife,
Christine, and watch the show.<
Mr Al Fayed, dressed in his trademark patterned shirts with contrasting white
collar and always a black tie - in mourning for his late son Dodi - sometimes
stood and sometimes sat in the witness box, sipping mineral water from the lid
of his own silver flask.<
In full spate, he was unstoppable, over-riding Mr Carman, Mr Browne and the
judge _ none of them shrinking violets _ to have his colourful say.<
Here was a man who saw his moment to right the many wrongs which he believed
had been done to him by an ungrateful British establishment and no-one, but
no-one, was going to get in his way.<
The only chink in a robust display came when Mr Carman mentioned Mr Browne's
reference to the death of Dodi and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, in a Paris
underpass two years ago.<
There were no tears from Mr Al Fayed, no flamboyant displays of grief, no
florid language, but a halting attack on the ``inhumane'' attempt, as he saw it,
by Mr Browne to ``capitalise'' on his grief and that of ``the family of the two
beautiful kids who have lost their mother''.<
But the rest of the time was devoted to good knockabout stuff _ music hall
humour spiced with wicked vitriol which had a packed public gallery rocking with
mirth.<
Mr Al Fayed was the ``Ali Baba of deceit'', a vindictive Jekyll and Hyde
character for whom lying had become a sickness, said Mr Browne.<
Later on, during a boisterous exchange with the Eton-educated barrister over
his right to use the prefix ``Al'', he said counsel could call him ``Von Fayed''
or even ``Al Capone'' if he liked.<
Mr Al Fayed's witnesses, which will include past and present employees and, it
is rumoured, former ministers Edwina Currie and Michael Heseltine, will follow
on with their evidence.<
Mr Hamilton, at whose request Mr Al Fayed is going first, must wait for nearly
two weeks before he gets the chance to rebut his tag, courtesy of Mr Carman, as
the man whose name is linked forever with the word ``sleaze''.<
It will be nearly Christmas before the jury of six women and five men _ one
male juror has had to stand down through illness _ will show Mr Al Fayed whether
he is right in his stated belief that he has the support of tens of thousands of
the British people.<
