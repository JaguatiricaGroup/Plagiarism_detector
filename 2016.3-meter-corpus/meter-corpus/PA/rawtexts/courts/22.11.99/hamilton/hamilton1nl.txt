FAYED CHALLENGES DUKE TO SUE OVER CONSPIRACY CLAIMS<
By Jan Colley and Cathy Gordon, PA News<
Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed today issued a challenge to the Duke of
Edinburgh to sue over his allegation that the Duke had ``masterminded'' a
conspiracy to kill his son Dodi and Diana, Princess of Wales.<
The Harrods owner said he had the right to say what he believed in his bid to
discover the truth behind the car crash in a Paris underpass more than two years
ago.<
The claims came during Mr Al Fayed's cross-examination by Desmond Browne QC,
for Neil Hamilton, on the third day of the former minister's High Court ``cash
for questions'' libel action.<
Mr Hamilton, the former Conservative MP for Tatton, is suing Mr Al Fayed over
a January 1997 Channel 4 Dispatches programme.<
He alleged in the programme that Mr Hamilton had corruptly demanded and
accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in
return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods.<
Mr Al Fayed, who denies libel and pleads justification, claims that Mr
Hamilton received cash sums of up to #30,000 and gift vouchers worth #8,000.<
Referring to the ``awful accident'' in Paris, Mr Browne said that Mr Al Fayed
was trying to persuade the public that it was not caused by his employee, driver
Henri Paul, but was the result of a conspiracy to murder the couple before they
could marry.<
He said that in order to give substance to that thesis, Mr Al Fayed had
``quite falsely on a number of occasions'' accused the Duke of Edinburgh of
``masterminding'' the conspiracy to kill the couple.<
Mr Al Fayed told the jury and Mr Justice Morland: ``I have no comments and I
have the right to say what I feel and tell my suspicions.''<
It was, he said, ``completely irrelevant'' to the Hamilton action.<
Mr Browne: ``Did you not say that Prince Philip had masterminded it because he
has German blood and Nazi views?''<
Mr Al Fayed replied: ``I have the right to say what I feel and what I believe.
I have a lot of support, I receive millions of letters.<
He agreed that he had expressed his views in FHM magazine, in his column in
Punch, on the Internet, in the Sunday Express and on Radio 4's Today programme.<
``I say I have the right and I am keeping on doing that until I find the
truth''.<
He added: ``Let Prince Philip sue me. Let MI5 and MI6 sue me ... they know
they are above the law.''<
Later, in questioning over a September 1994 conversation which Mr Al Fayed had
with then Sunday Express editor Brian Hitchen, Mr Browne asked whether his
reference to someone's homosexuality was aimed at political lobbyist Ian Greer.<
Mr Al Fayed replied: ``To the best of my recollection.''<
Mr Browne then referred to a comment made by Mr Al Fayed during the
conversation that: ``Neil Hamilton is renting boys for him''.<
Mr Browne: ``What possible grounds did you have for telling this editor of a
national newspaper ... that Neil Hamilton had been renting boys for Ian
Greer?''. What ground for making that venomous accusation?''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``There was rumours and I am sure it is true.''<
Counsel suggested it was another ``venomous invention of your fertile mind
which will stop at nothing to blackguard Mr Hamilton's good name''.<
Mr Al Fayed: ``No, I trust the people who have told me this news. I am sure of
it.''<
