FAYED APPEALS TO JUDGE OVER DI AND DODI QUESTIONS<
By Cathy Gordon and Jan Colley, PA News<
Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed today appealed to the judge in the Neil Hamilton
libel trial to stop the former Tory minister's barrister from asking him
questions about the deaths of his son, Dodi, and Diana, Princess of Wales.<
Minutes into the second day of his cross-examination by Mr Desmond Browne, QC,
Mr Al Fayed became upset at the line of questioning.<
From the witness box in the packed Court 13 at London's Law Courts, he told Mr
Browne: ``I have told you before I am a father who has lost his son and I have
the right to do anything to find out how I lost my son and, please, I have asked
you several times not to capitalise on my grief.''<
Turning towards Mr Justice Morland, Mr Al Fayed raised his arms despairingly
and said: ``I appeal to the judge ... not to carry on because he gains
nothing.''<
Mr Browne told him: ``Mr Al Fayed, I am not capitalising on your grief. I am
asking you about matters you have made public yourself.''<
The Harrods chief then asked the barrister ``not to aggravate me for something
very, very sensitive''.<
At this point the judge intervened and told Mr Al Fayed it would be easier if
he listened to counsel's question and answered it shortly ``and Mr Browne will
be careful, I am sure, not to prolong this line of cross-examination any longer
than is absolutely necessary''.<
Mr Al Fayed replied: ``Thank you my lord.''<
Mr Hamilton was sitting at the front of the court with his legal team as the
exchange took place on the third day of his libel action against Mr Al Fayed.<
Mr Hamilton, the former Conservative MP for Tatton, is suing Mr Al Fayed over
a January 1997 Channel 4 Dispatches programme.<
He alleged in the programme that Mr Hamilton had corruptly demanded and
accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in
return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods.<
Mr Al Fayed, who denies libel and pleads justification, claims that Mr
Hamilton received cash sums of up to #30,000 and gift vouchers worth #8,000.<
Today's clash came as Mr Browne asked Mr Al Fayed about his knowledge of the
``thrust'' of a television programme broadcast on the ITV network in June 1998
about the ``secrets'' behind the Paris car crash in which his son and the
Princess died.<
He asked Mr Al Fayed if he had known when he was interviewed for the programme
that it was ``likely to suggest that the crash had been a conspiracy and not an
accident''.<
Mr Browne put to him: ``You believed at this time, did you not, that the crash
had not been an accident, but the result of a conspiracy?''<
It was at this point that Mr Al Fayed then accused him of capitalising on his
grief.<
Asked the same question again, after the judge's intervention, Mr Al Fayed
said: ``I have the right to believe everything. I have the right to find out how
my son has been killed.<
