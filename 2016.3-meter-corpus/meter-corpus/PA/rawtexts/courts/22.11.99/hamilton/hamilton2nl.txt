  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the day, Mr Al Fayed also referred to the recent revelations about
Jeffrey Archer, which had their source in a libel action played out in the same
surroundings - Court 13 - more than 12 years ago.<
Asked about whether he had once talked to a journalist about morals and ethics
in Britain being more important than anywhere else, Mr Al Fayed said: ``That was
what I thought when I arrived...''<
Then he said: ``You saw again exactly that yesterday...somebody who wants to
be Mayor of London...another British politician.''<
Mr Browne pointed out that this was ``not relevant''.<
The judge interposed: ``The jury I am sure are fully aware of the fact that
the Archer case has nothing to do with this case.''<
Mr Al Fayed commented: ``I am just giving an example, your lordship.''<
Later, Mr Al Fayed said he did not make allegations against others out of
revenge, but that it was ``a matter of flushing out crooked people in political
life''.<
He then referred to Jonathan Aitken, at which point the judge said: ``You have
mentioned the Aitken business a number of times. We are not dealing with that in
this court today.''<
Mr Al Fayed replied: ``I am sorry. I am just trying to explain the quality of
people.''<
Mr Browne: ``Are you trying, by dragging in these references to Lord Archer
and Mr Aitken, to taint Mr Hamilton? Is that what you are doing?''<
Mr Al Fayed told him: ``It's just to confirm that he is not the only
person.''<
Turning to the critical DTI report into the purchase of Harrods, Mr Browne
said that former Home Secretary Michael Howard had earned Mr Al Fayed's
``undying enmity'' for appointing the inspectors in April 1987.<
Mr Browne: ``Your suggestion is, and I contend that it is utterly baseless,
that he had been bribed by Tiny Rowland to do so.''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``Why are you so sure it was baseless? I am the person who knows
exactly how it happened - #1 million and half a million.''<
Mr Browne asked if it was not possible that Mr Howard had not sued Mr Al Fayed
over the allegation because he regarded it as beneath contempt and so obviously
untrue that it did not merit proceedings.<
Mr Al Fayed: ``No - if he had any dignity or honour and knows he hasn't
committed a crime, he would sue me.''<
Mr Browne suggested that the allegation about Mr Howard was as untrue as what
Mr Al Fayed had said about the Duke of Edinburgh.<
Mr Al Fayed: ``I say about the tragedy what I believe. I believe because I'm
so close. I was so close to Princess Diana and I know what happened to her in
the years of her marriage.''<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
