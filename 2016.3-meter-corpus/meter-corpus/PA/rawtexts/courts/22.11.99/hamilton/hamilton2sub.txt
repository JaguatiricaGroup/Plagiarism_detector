Mr Browne asked Mr Al Fayed about an article in the Sunday Mirror in August 1998
in which he said that there was no doubt that Dodi and Diana would have married,
and that they spent a couple of hours on their last afternoon looking around
Villa Windsor in Paris, the former home of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.<
He said that two days later The Sun accused Mr Al Fayed of lying over a
planned engagement between the couple.<
Mr Al Fayed dismissed the Sun's article as ``garbage''.<
``I am the father. I know exactly what my son is doing. Everyone else - it's
just jealousy, envy.''<
Asked why he did not sue for libel over the article, Mr Al Fayed said: ``I
don't need to sue every newspaper because on a daily basis I am insulted by the
establishment.''<
Mr Browne said that the security guard at the Villa Windsor had told The Sun
that the couple visited for just 28 minutes and had provided video-tape to back
up his story.<
Mr Al Fayed dismissed the man as a ``corrupt ex-employee'' who had stolen the
video and gone to the newspaper for a #50,000 payment.<
Turning to Henri Paul, the driver of the car in which the couple died, Mr Al
Fayed denied that he was drunk at the time of the crash.<
Mr Browne: ``He was three times over the French drink-driving limit.''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``No, it was not true and I'm going to prove that. It's still
under investigation which I can't comment about.''<
He added that he could also not comment on whether Paul was over the speed
limit.<
Mr Browne said that in order to give substance to his conspiracy theory, Mr Al
Fayed had ``quite falsely on a number of occasions'' accused the Duke of
Edinburgh of ``masterminding'' it.<
Mr Al Fayed: ``I have no comments and I have the right to say what I feel and
tell my suspicions.''<
It was, he said, ``completely irrelevant'' to the action.<
Mr Browne: ``Did you not say that Prince Philip had masterminded it because he
has German blood and Nazi views?''<
Mr Al Fayed replied: ``I have the right to say what I feel and what I believe.
I have a lot of support, I receive millions of letters.<
He added: ``Let Prince Philip sue me. Let MI5 and MI6 sue me ... they know
they are above the law.''<
He said that he had submitted complaints to the Prime Minister, the Foreign
Secretary and the Home Secretary, asking for a public inquiry into the affair.<
