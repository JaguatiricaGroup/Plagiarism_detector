(Reopens)<
Mr Browne asked Mr Al Fayed about a taped conversation he had in September
1994 with Brian Hitchen, then editor of the Sunday Express.<
He said Mr Hitchen had asked ``how much did you pay him?'', referring to Mr
Hamilton.<
Mr Al Fayed told the editor, ``through Ian Greer, maybe over #50,000''.<
The jury has been told that Ian Greer was the highly influential political
lobbyist recommended to Mr Al Fayed to counter an attack being waged against him
by rival businessman Tiny Rowland.<
Mr Browne said that there was no reference in the conversation to Mr Hamilton
being paid cash.<
Mr Al Fayed said this did not mean that he did not pay Mr Hamilton cash.<
Mr Browne put to him: ``Are you telling the jury now that Mr Hamilton received
over #50,000 through Ian Greer from you?''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``That's right.''<
Mr Browne: ``And that in addition he received cash directly from you?''<
Mr Al Fayed agreed.<
Mr Browne: ``How much in addition to the #50,000 received through Mr Greer do
you say Mr Hamilton got from you?''<
Mr Al Fayed replied: ``Over #40,000. It's possible #60,000. I can't remember
precisely, it was many years ago.''<
Mr Browne: ``You are saying that it is possible in combination between the
money that Mr Hamilton got through Ian Greer and the cash he got directly from
you, he got between #90,000 and #110,000?''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``It's possible.''<
Mr Browne: ``That total of #90,000 to #110,000 that Mr Hamilton might have
received has never been suggested before and forms no part whatsoever of your
defence in this case.''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``It is to the best of my recollection.''<
Mr Browne: ``You are making up these allegations against Mr Hamilton as you go
along and you have just made an allegation that you have never made before.''<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
