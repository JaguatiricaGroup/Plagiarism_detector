As the cross-examination of Mr Al Fayed continued about his background, he made
reference to the Lord Archer revelations.<
Mr Browne was asking him about a conversation he once had with a national
newspaper journalist and whether Mr Al Fayed had talked about morals and ethics
in Britain being more important than anywhere else.<
Mr Al Fayed said that was ``what I thought when I arrived...''<
Then he said: ``You saw again exactly that yesterday...somebody who wants to
be Mayor of London...another British politician.''<
Mr Browne pointed out that this matter was ``not relevant''.<
The judge interposed: ``The jury I am sure are fully aware of the fact that
the Archer case has nothing to do with this case.''<
Mr Al Fayed commented: ``I am just giving an example your lordship.''<
