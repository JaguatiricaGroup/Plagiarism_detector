  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Browne referred to libel litigation commenced by Mr Al Fayed over a March
1985 article in The Observer which challenged his assertion that he bought
Harrods with his own money.<
Mr Al Fayed denied that he subsequently amended the action so as to avoid
disclosing documents about how he paid for the store.<
``Absolutely not...why I have to open my private business to someone who has
no right.''<
Mr Browne said that The Observer claimed that Mr Al Fayed's assets never
exceeded #62 million at most.<
Mr Al Fayed said that they could say what they wanted but he knew what he
had.<
He added that he ultimately abandoned the action, in July 1989, only on the
advice of his lawyers.<
Mr Browne said that The Observer action was only one of a number brought or
threatened by Mr Al Fayed at the time against newspapers wish suggested that the
money to buy Harrods did not come from his own resources.<
``I'm suggesting that you used litigation and the threat of litigation to gag
the press and try to conceal the truth.''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``I don't need to conceal anything. I have a legal department
handling all these matters for me.''<
Mr Browne said that the solicitors and barristers concerned in the case on Mr
Al Fayed's behalf all got Christmas hampers from Harrods in 1988/89.<
Mr Al Fayed: ``What's the fuss about hampers? It's part of the tradition that
people who have been serving you, been kind to you, friends - you send them a
hamper.''<
Mr Browne pointed out that Mr Al Fayed claimed that receiving a hamper - as Mr
Hamilton had done - was another example of corruption.<
Mr Al Fayed said that the hamper had nothing to do with it. The case, he said,
was about ``money, greed, money grubbing, people who have no principle''.<
Mr Browne replied: ``This may be a circus for you. For Mr Hamilton, it's a
serious matter.''<
Mr Al Fayed protested that he had great respect for the court.<
Mr Browne persisted: ``On Friday you came out of court, posed for the
photographers and offered to dance for them.''<
Mr Al Fayed said that people had been standing there all day and they moved
around him as he went to walk to his car.<
``I didn't offer to dance. I was just joking because they surrounded me.
What's wrong with that?''<
