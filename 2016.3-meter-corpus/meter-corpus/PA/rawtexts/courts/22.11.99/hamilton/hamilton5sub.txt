Turning to the DTI report into the Harrods purchase, Mr Browne said that former
Home Secretary Michael Howard had earned Mr Al Fayed's ``undying enmity'' for
appointing the inspectors in April 1987.<
Mr Browne: ``Your suggestion is, and I contend that it is utterly baseless,
that he had been bribed by Tiny Rowland to do so.''<
Mr Al Fayed: ``Why are you so sure it was baseless? I am the person who knows
exactly how it happened - #1m and half a million.''<
Mr Browne asked if it was not possible that Mr Howard had not sued Mr Al Fayed
over the allegation because he regarded it as beneath contempt and so obviously
untrue that it did not merit proceedings.<
Mr Al Fayed: ``No - if he had any dignity or honour and knows he hasn't
committed a crime, he would sue me.''<
Mr Browne suggested that the allegation about Mr Howard was as untrue as what
Mr Al Fayed had said about the Duke of Edinburgh.<
Mr Al Fayed: ``I say about the tragedy what I believe. I believe because I'm
so close. I was so close to Princess Diana and I know what happened to her in
the years of her marriage.''<
Mr Browne said the DTI report in July 1998 found that Mr Al Fayed and his
brothers had dishonestly misrepresented their origins and wealth, business
interests and resources to the Secretary of State, the Office of Fair Trading,
the press, the House of Fraser board and shareholders, and their own advisers.<
Mr Al Fayed said he did not accept the findings and called the inspectors
``naive''.<
``It's not true and they built on what Tiny Rowland put to them. There is no
documentation, no proof.''<
He said that the report had been passed to the DPP, which did not find
anything.<
``It was all built on hearsay - Tiny Rowland's lies and corrupt witnesses.<
``The findings are not acceptable, not credible, because I'm not able to
cross-examine witnesses who have been paid millions.''<
