  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Al Fayed said he did not make allegations against others out of revenge, but
that it was ``a matter of flushing out crooked people in political life''.<
He then made another reference to Jonathan Aitken, at which point the judge
intervened and said: ``You have mentioned the Aitken business a number of times.
We are not dealing with that in this court today.''<
Mr Al Fayed replied: ``I am sorry. I am just trying to explain the quality of
people.''<
Mr Browne put to him: ``Are you trying, by dragging in these references to
Lord Archer and Mr Aitken, to taint Mr Hamilton? Is that what you are doing?''<
In reply Mr Al Fayed told him: ``It's just to confirm that he is not the only
person.''<
Mr Browne: ``Will you please not do it again. You have had a warning from my
lord.''<
To laughter Mr Al Fayed commented: ``If his lordship asks me to, I keep
quiet.''<
