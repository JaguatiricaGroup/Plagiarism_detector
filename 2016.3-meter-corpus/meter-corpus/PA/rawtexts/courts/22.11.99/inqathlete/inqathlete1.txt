ATHLETE'S DEATH `MAY HAVE BEEN REACTION TO DRUGS'<
By Mark Wilkinson, PA News<
An international athlete who died in a hospital's mental health unit may have
suffocated on a pillow or suffered a reaction to anti-psychotic drugs, an
inquest was told today.<
Sophia Smith, 24, was a member of the Great Britain 4 x 100m relay team which
competed in the 1996 world champions in Sweden.<
But she suffered a nervous breakdown nearly two years ago and died at Nether
Edge Hospital, in her home town of Sheffield, in May.<
She had been receiving treatment for disturbed behaviour for several weeks
before being found face down in a pillow on her hospital bed, the inquest, at
Sheffield, was told.<
Pathologist Dr John Clark said tests had failed to pinpoint the exact cause of
death but said it was unlikely that she had died after being restrained.<
There were minor signs that her brain had been starved of oxygen, which he
suggested this may have been caused by her airways being obstructed by the
pillow or by a reaction to anti-psychotic drugs she had been taking.<
Toxicologist Professor Robert Forest said that the side-effects were extremely
rare but could sometimes lead to a patient's heart being affected.<
There was no overdose, he added, stressing that it was not possible to say
definitively what had happened.<
Miss Smith, a student at Loughborough University, had competed all over the
world and was friends with Linford Christie and 400m European Gold medallist
Jamie Baulch.<
Her parents, Horace and Evelyn Smith said at the time of her death that the
pressure of top competition and her studies could have contributed to her
breakdown.<
