Consultant psychologist Dr Christopher Wallbridge said Miss Smith had suffered
episodes of extremely disturbing behaviour in the weeks before her death. The
anti-psychotic drugs had appeared to be useful in controlling her behaviour.<
``During her most acute episodes she was extremely agitated and under the
delusion that she was Jesus Christ and had to hurt herself to save the world.<
``Between these episodes she was much calmer and could hold conversations but
she was still under the delusion about saving the world.''<
He said a couple of days before her death she had suffered an acute episode
and had injured her face by pushing it to the floor in a bid to ``get to
heaven''.<
In his notes, Dr Wallbridge wrote that she was a candidate for an intensive
care unit but no places were available.<
He said he was aware that anti-psychotic drugs had been associated with sudden
deaths but stressed the risks were extremely low.<
``We would have been more concerned with somebody who was older, less fit and
suffering other problems but the risks with Sophia were considered to be very
small. The risk of her harming herself without the drugs were considered much
greater.''<
He added that Miss Smith would have been made aware of the side effects of the
drugs, like stiffness, shaking and blurred vision, but would not have been told
of the potential for sudden death because the chances were so low.<
Pathologist John Clark, who was recalled to the witness box, said it was
possible that neither suffocation nor drug side effects were responsible for her
death.<
``I have seen many more cases of young people dying suddenly with no obvious
reasons whatsoever than because of anti-psychotic drugs' side effects. Really, I
do not know why she died.''<
