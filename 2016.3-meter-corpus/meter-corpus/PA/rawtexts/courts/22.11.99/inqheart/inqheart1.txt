WHISTLEBLOWER TO APPEAR AT BRISTOL HEART BABIES INQUIRY<
By Allan Smith, PA News<
Whistleblower Dr Stephen Bolsin is to give evidence to the multi-million pound
public inquiry into the Bristol heart babies scandal today.<
The consultant anaesthetist has travelled from his hospital in Geelong,
Australia, to be the key witness at public hearings in Bristol.<
It was his allegations _ after he joined Bristol Royal Infirmary as a
consultant in 1988 _ which led to surgeons James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana
and former BRI chief executive Dr John Roylance being disciplined by a General
Medical Council inquiry.<
Dr Bolsin, now Director of Anaesthesia at Geelong Hospital, Victoria, has also
claimed that four other BRI anaesthetists should be investigated, although he
has not publicly named them.<
He further alleges that he was shunned by the medical establishment over his
efforts to expose the high death rates for certain surgical procedures in the
BRI unit handling complex heart operations on babies and children.<
The four-member inquiry panel is expected to probe these allegations during
the four days that Dr Bolsin will be the sole witness to the public hearings.<
The focus is likely to be on the origin of his concerns and the efforts he
made to raise them with his bosses. He carried out an audit of the unit's
surgical performance but alleges that the hospital trust took no action over his
concerns.<
A months-long GMC inquiry brought in findings of serious professional
misconduct against surgeons Mr Wisheart and Mr Dhasmana and Dr Roylance. It had
investigated 53 operations on children carried out by the surgeons after which
29 died and four were left brain-damaged.<
Mr Wisheart and Dr Roylance, both retired, were struck off. Mr Dhasmana was
banned from operating on children for three years.<
He is now appealing against his later dismissal by the BRI. Mr Dhasmana is to
give evidence for the first time at the public inquiry the week after Dr Bolsin.
Mr Wisheart and Dr Roylance were previous witnesses but are to be recalled next
month for further questioning.<
