WHISTLEBLOWER'S TEARS FOR HEART-OP VICTIMS<
By Allan Smith, PA News<
Whistleblower Dr Stephen Bolsin broke down today as he paid an emotional
tribute to children who died in the heart surgery unit of the shamed Bristol
Royal Infirmary.<
He choked back tears as he made a short personal tribute at the end of his
first morning of evidence before the multi-million pound public inquiry sitting
in Bristol.<
He paused for a few moments in making his statement but refused a suggestion
by the senior inquiry counsel Mr Brian Langstaff QC, that he take a short break
from the witness box where he is expected to spend the next four days giving
evidence.<
He was watched closely from the crowded public gallery containing a number of
parents who lost children in the 12 years before 1995 which are being reviewed
by the inquiry.<
And his wife Margaret and his own son and daughter also listened intently as
the tall, dark-haired doctor said: ``We shall be talking about mortality rates
and the number of excessive deaths.<
``I wanted to say that I sympathise enormously with the parents who have been
through the situation of children undergoing open-heart surgery, complex
paediatric cardiac surgery, and for those parents whose children did not
survive.<
``I wanted to let them know that for me they were all individual children who
had families.''<
The consultant anaesthetist fought back tears as, head bowed, he composed
himself and added: ``I am very sorry for what happened to them.''<
Earlier he claimed that the heart surgery unit patients at risk to maintain
Government funding.<
Dr Bolsin, who is generally credited with exposing the Bristol heart baby
scandal, said he felt that staff wanted to maintain the hospital unit's
designation as a specialist heart facility.<
It was a main reason, he submitted, behind his inability to get action from
hospital bosses over his concerns about the high mortality rate among babies
undergoing complex heart surgery.<
He recalled a conversation with the Director of Anaesthesia, Chris Monk, where
they were considering whether the unit could be stopped from undertaking some
high risk operations.<
They wanted a review, he said.<
``The analogy that was used was of a train where occasional passengers were
falling off, and the train had to keep moving in order to attract funding.<
``That was one of my concerns about the subjugation of patient safety by
reasons of funding and continued activity in high risk areas.<
``My impression of this unit was that the commitment of staff was to keep
doing the things they felt were important to designation, irrespective of risk
to patients.''<
Mr Bolsin, who is now Director of Anaesthesia at Geelong Hospital, near
Melbourne, Victoria, flew in from Australia this weekend to give evidence at the
hearing.<
It follows a General Medical Council inquiry which was sparked off by
allegations made by Mr Bolsin over the high death rate in the baby surgical
duty.<
The disciplinary inquiry brought in findings of serious professional
misconduct against BRI surgeons James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana and former
chief executive Dr John Roylance.<
The GMC hearing had investigated 53 operations carried out by the two surgeons
after which 29 patients died and four were left brain injured.<
The public inquiry is investigating around 2,000 operations on babies at the
hospital.<
Dr Bolsin is expected to be quizzed over his claims that he was repeatedly
rebuffed by hospital bosses when he tried to raise his concerns. As a result he
went outside the hospital in a bid to expose the death rates which he calculated
for some operations to be double the national average.<
  The consultant has claimed that he was shunned by the medical establishment
in making his exposures, and that this forced him to seek a job outside
Britain.<
