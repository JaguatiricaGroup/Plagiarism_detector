HEART-OP PATIENTS PUT AT RISK TO KEEP FUNDING STATUS, INQUIRY TOLD<
By Allan Smith, PA News<
Whistleblower Dr Stephen Bolsin claimed today that the shamed heart surgery
unit at Bristol Royal Infirmary put patients at risk to maintain Government
funding.<
The consultant anaesthetist, who is generally credited with exposing the
Bristol heart baby scandal, said he felt that staff wanted to maintain the
hospital unit's designation as a specialist heart facility.<
It was a main reason, he submitted, behind his inability to get action from
hospital bosses over his concerns about the high mortality rate among babies
undergoing complex heart surgery.<
He told the four member panel at the public inquiry in Bristol that he
repeatedly tried to raise concerns with his bosses.<
And he recalled a conversation with the Director of Anaesthesia, Chris Monk,
where they were considering whether the unit could be stopped from undertaking
some high risk operations.<
They wanted a review, he said.<
He told Mr Brian Langstaff QC, the inquiry's senior counsel: ``The analogy
that was used was of a train where occasional passengers were falling off, and
the train had to keep moving in order to attract funding.<
``That was one of my concerns about the subjugation of patient safety by
reasons of funding and continued activity in high risk areas.<
``My impression of this unit was that the commitment of staff was to keep
doing the things they felt were important to designation, irrespective of risk
to patients.''<
Mr Bolsin, who is now Director of Anaesthesia at Geelong Hospital, near
Melbourne, Victoria, flew in from Australia this weekend to give evidence at the
public hearing due to end in Bristol next month.<
His wife Margaret and their son and daughter were in the public gallery as he
began his expected four days of evidence as the sole witness this week.<
The public inquiry is investigating the care and treatment of children
undergoing heart operations at the BRI in the 12 years to 1995.<
It follows a General Medical Council inquiry which was sparked off by
allegations made by Mr Bolsin over the high death rate in the baby surgical
duty.<
The disciplinary inquiry brought in findings of serious professional
misconduct against BRI surgeons James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana and former
chief executive Dr John Roylance.<
The GMC hearing had investigated 53 operations carried out by the two surgeons
after which 29 patients died and four were left brain injured.<
The public inquiry is investigating around 2,000 operations on babies at the
hospital.<
Mr Bolsin is expected to be quizzed over his claims that he was repeatedly
rebuffed by hospital bosses when he tried to raise his concerns. As a result he
went outside the hospital in a bid to expose the death rates which he calculated
for some operations to be double the national average.<
