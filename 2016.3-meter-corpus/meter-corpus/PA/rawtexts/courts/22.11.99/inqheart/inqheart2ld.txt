               16:20 22/11/99: Page 2 (HHH) INQUIRY Heart Lead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Later Dr Bolsin claimed his fears about the number of deaths of under
one-year-olds were dismissed by hospital officials.<
He Bolsin told the inquiry he wrote to the then BRI manager John Roylance in
August 1990 asking for action on the number of deaths of under one-year-olds
nine years ago.<
But he claimed Mr Roylance only replied with a ``dismissive'' telephone call
while disgraced surgeon Dr Wisheart was ``very angry'' with him for taking his
concerns outside the cardiac unit.<
Dr Bolsin said he wrote to Mr Roylance saying he was worried about the high
mortality rate of babies undergoing surgery.<
``I was seeking an investigation. I would have expected the cardiologists,
surgeons and an independent person to say: `This is a serious allegation and
let's look at the results.'''<
But Dr Bolsin said he didn't push for action after receiving a ``relatively
dismissive telephone call'' and one conversation with Mr Roylance as a result of
his letter.<
The inquiry heard he copied his letter to medical bodies, including the head
of the hospital, the chairman of the district health authority and the head of
the anaesthesia division.<
He said he was later called to a meeting in Mr Wisheart's office, where his
letter was placed on the table.<
He said: ``Mr Wisheart made it quite clear this was not the way to progress my
career in Bristol. He was very angry that a young consultant had taken results
outside the unit and expressed them to non-cardiac units.''<
The inquiry heard Mr Wisheart has denied the meeting and conversation took
place.<
Dr Bolsin claimed his colleagues at the Bristol hospital were also worried
about the length of time operations took.<
But he said senior anaesthetist colleagues told him to ``keep his head down''
and leave it to his senior colleagues to raise concerns with the paediatric
cardiac surgeons.<
The consultant said he noticed from his first day working in the hospital that
operations took longer than in the Royal Brompton Hospital in London where he
worked before.<
