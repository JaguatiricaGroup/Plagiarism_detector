            13:02 22/11/99: Page 2 (HHH) INQUIRY Heart Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The consultant has claimed that he was shunned by the medical establishment in
making his exposures, and that this forced him to seek a job outside Britain.<
He told, today, how he joined the BRI in 1988, from London's Great Ormond
Street Hospital and how he looked forward to working in the Bristol teaching
hospital in his new role.<
But by the early 90s he became concerned over the death rates for some
procedures and by 1992 no longer wanted to be associated with the Bristol unit.<
He tried, but failed, to get a job elsewhere and by 1993 he had withdrawn from
working as an anaesthetist in supporting Mr Wisheart in operations and his rota
meant that he had a reduced workload in the paediatric cardiac unit.<
He told the inquiry that by the mid 90s he and the two surgeons were involved
in counselling sessions, involving psychiatrists and aimed at reconciliation
after a breakdown in their relationships.<
But, he said, there was only one meeting in which the three came together and
there was still a ``gulf'' between them. He stopped going to sessions after he
accepted his job in Australia.<
Mr Bolsin was giving evidence in support of two statements he had made to the
inquiry, totalling more than 140 pages of evidence.<
He agreed that in earlier draft statements he had made allegations about
Freemasonry and payment of merit awards to surgeons. But he maintained that he
had since withdrawn these allegations.<
He was quizzed about talks he had had with a BMA representative over a
possible claim of constructive dismissal against the hospital.<
Mr Bolsin denied that he used this potential claim and a projected television
programme as threats to pressurise the board into making ex-gratia payments.<
Mr Langstaff asked: ``You were putting a gun to the head of the Trust and
saying `pay me or I will go public?'''<
Mr Bolsin replied: ``That is not the way I saw the request I was making. It
was a perfectly human reason for compensation for disruption to my family
life.''<
