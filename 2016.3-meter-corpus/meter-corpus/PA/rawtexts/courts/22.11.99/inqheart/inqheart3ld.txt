Mr Bolsin recalled a 1990 meeting he attended with cardiac surgeons,
cardiologists and anaesthetists. They considered the 1989 figures for the unit,
which showed that 14 patients died in 39 operations. At that time there were no
national statistics available to compare with the 35% mortality rate.<
He believed then that something urgent had to be done, based on their present
data. He maintained: ``If these children had been sent to a hospital with the
national average or better they would have survived. Would a child have survived
in another hospital? If the answer was `Yes' it was urgent that we did not
expose that child to any further risk.''<
When national average figures later became available, they showed that
Bristol's mortality figures were double those of elsewhere.<
He could not remember any alarm in the hospital over these results. But he
then wrote to Dr Roylance about his concerns over the mortality rate. He said
there was a ``rising tide'' of concern on his part and some of his colleagues.<
He added: ``There was always a sensitivity in the unit on the part of the
surgeons that their results were becoming increasingly apparent as time went on.
It was a very difficult, very intangible thing, that there was enormous
sensitivity over poor results of paediatric cardiac surgery.''<
