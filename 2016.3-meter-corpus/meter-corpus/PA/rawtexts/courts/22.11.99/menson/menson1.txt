BLAZE VICTIM TOLD ME OF ATTACK, SAYS BROTHER<
By Pat Clarke, PA News<
A black rock musician who died after being turned into a human torch in an
alleged street attack told his brother that he took off his clothes and rolled
on the ground in a bid to put out the flames, an Old Bailey court heard today.<
Kwesi Menson said his brother Michael Menson told him that he was attacked by
white youth near a telephone kiosk in Edmonton, north London.<
Kwesi Menson said he made notes of what his brother said during visits to him
in a hospital specialist unit where he underwent operations to treat burns
covering 30% of his body.<
Michael Menson died two weeks after being found on fire.<
Kwesi Menson said his 30-year-old brother told him he had got off a bus near a
church and telephone kiosk and leaned on the church gate.<
``They did not say anything to me. The next thing I knew I was on fire,'' the
musician told him.<
``I ran down the road to where people were. I put myself out on the ground. I
rolled about on the floor.<
``I took off all my clothes. I did not have shoes on. The people came to my
aid _ that is all I remember.<
``I knew I was on fire. I tried to put myself out with my hands. Some people
came to help me. Then they called an ambulance. It seemed quick in coming.''<
Kwesi Menson was giving evidence on the fifth day of the trial of two men
accused of murdering Michael Menson in Edmonton, north London, in early 1997.<
Kwesi Menson said that on the final occasion they spoke of the fire, he told
Michael he  was writing down everything he said.<
``He was upset I was asking him again, but I said I was taking it down and it
was important. He agreed with what I wrote down. I did not speak to Michael
again about what happened.''<
Unemployed Harry Constantinou, 26, and student Mario Pereira, 26, deny
murdering him.<
Both men, and a third defendant, unemployed Husseyin Abdullah, 50, all deny
charges of perverting the course of justice by hindering the police inquiry.<
All three men are from Edmonton, north London.<
Michael Menson, the son of a Ghanaian diplomat, was a successful singer in the
1980s but had suffered from mental illness in the years before his death.<
