LIFE FOR MAN WHO TRIED TO KILL HIS UNBORN BABY<
By Paul Watson, PA News<
A 26-year-old man was today given two life sentences at Newcastle Crown Court
for a ``brutal and frenzied'' attack on his pregnant former girlfriend and their
unborn child.<
Jobless Brian Smith pleaded guilty to a charge of wounding with intent on
Amanda Hunter, 21, in the grounds of Sunderland Royal Hospital last November and
a further charge of attempted child destruction.<
The court heard how Smith, of Thorny Close, Sunderland, struck as Miss Hunter
attended an ante-natal clinic at the Wearside hospital, repeatedly stabbing her
in the stomach with a three and a half inch kitchen knife.<
Paul Batty, QC, prosecuting, told the court: ``This is about as bad a case as
one can imagine.<
``He has admitted his intention to destroy the life of an unborn child his
ex-girlfriend was carrying.<
``It was a brutal and frenzied attack on a woman who was eight and a half
months pregnant.''<
The judge Mrs Justice Hallett imposed two life sentences and made a
recommendation that Smith should serve eight years before being eligible for
parole.<
She told Smith: ``Fortunately you chose to carry out this attack at a hospital
and Amanda and the unborn child were able to receive prompt medical care.<
``We shall never forget the day we saw these photographs of your little baby
carrying the marks of your attack.''<
Miss Hunter, who was 20 at the time of the attack, is now fully recovered and
the injured baby, named Bailey, was one-year-old last week.<
Miss Hunter, of Ford Estate, Sunderland, was not in court today to see her
ex-boyfriend jailed.<
