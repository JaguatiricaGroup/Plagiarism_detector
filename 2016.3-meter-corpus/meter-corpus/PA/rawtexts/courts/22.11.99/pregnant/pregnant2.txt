  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The court heard that Smith had a history of convictions for violence against
both men and women.<
On one occasion he stabbed a previous girlfriend and on another he was
convicted of attempted rape after attacking a woman in a park.<
He also has convictions for assaulting police, affray, and unlawful wounding
after an incident in which he battered a man with a baseball bat.<
He met Miss Hunter in 1997 and in March 1998 the couple became engaged and
later discovered they were to become parents.<
Smith was devastated after hearing that she wanted to end their relationship
because of his violent behaviour and drinking habits.<
The court heard how her mother had warned her about Smith and was concerned
because of his background.<
Days before the attack Smith left their home and slept rough for a couple of
nights before confronting Miss Hunter in the grounds of the hospital where he
knew she would be attending an ante-natal class.<
Roger Thorn, QC, defending, told the court the couple had been happy together
until Miss Hunter's mother began interfering in the relationship and tried to
talk her daughter into leaving him.<
``Amanda was torn between a commitment to Brian and the advice she was getting
from her mother.<
``Part of the explanation of what happened is the exceptional pressures and
stresses that were put upon him.<
``It was not a planned attack. He was in such a state of upheaval he did not
know what was on his mind.''<
During the attack Miss Hunter was thrown to the ground and stabbed in the
stomach. Doctors later carried out an emergency Caesarean section and delivered
her baby. Medics later said that the unborn child had deflected the knife and
saved the mother's life.<
Mr Thorn told the court that since his arrest last year Smith had been
regularly attacked inside Durham Prison and would probably have to spend the
majority of his sentence in solitary confinement.<
