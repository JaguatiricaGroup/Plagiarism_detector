TRAINEE SOLICITOR STOLE DOCUMENTS FROM RUBBISH BAGS<
By Sam Greenhill, PA News<
A would-be solicitor stole private documents from a firm of solicitors with
several highbrow clients, including James Hewitt and disgraced former Cabinet
minister Jonathan Aitken, a court was told today.<
Benjamin Pell, 35, took black rubbish bags from outside the Harley Street
offices of Harkavys in the dead of night, disguised as a Westminster Council
cleaner.<
Documents later found in his possession including solicitors' information that
revealed Aitken was embroiled in ``personal and public difficulties.''<
Edward Brown, prosecuting at Blackfriars Crown Court, said it was ``highly
likely'' Pell intended to try to sell the revelations to a publisher.<
The court heard that Pell's home in Tenterden Grove, Hendon, north London, was
full of black bags containing similar information.<
But in his defence the court heard that Pell had an obsession with collecting
rubbish.<
Pell, who is training to become a solicitor, was trapped after staff at
Harkavys became suspicious when rubbish left out for the binmen was being
interfered with over several nights in February this year.<
Then an environmental enforcement officer, alerted to an apparently abandoned
car belonging to Pell and parked near his home, discovered it ``full to the
brim'' with black plastic bags containing correspondence relating to solicitors'
clients.<
Among them, said Mr Brown, were documents relating to Aitken showing he was,
``embroiled in a number of personal and public difficulties.''<
He added that it was ``beyond coincidence'' that Pell had come into these
documents by accident. A newspaper cutting later found at the defendant's home
showed he was very interested in Mr Aitken, he said.<
Mr Brown said the documents on Mr Aitken related to private, criminal and
civil litigation as well as matrimonial issues.<
He said: ``That information would have been valuable to somebody. There is no
evidence that he sold the information to a publisher but there is a very high
likelihood that he would at least try.''<
Mr Brown added: ``The defendant claimed the reason for the car being full of
bags was that he was trying to save money on the cost of black plastic bags.''<
Because of concerns from Harkavys, police mounted a surveillance operation
outside the firm's Harley Street office on February 26.<
Mr Brown said: ``The defendant was seen going towards number 13 Harley Street
with some black bags. He opened the gate and walked down to the basement where
he was seen to swap his bags for the ones left out for the bin men.<
``He was returning to his vehicles with four bags when police stopped him.<
``He was wearing a hard hat with `Westminster' on the front. He said he was a
cleaner and intended to dump the bags for the firm. It was a disguise.''<
Police later that day searched Pell's home where they discovered an estimated
100,000-200,000 documents.<
Mr Brown said: ``The house was almost full of documents. A large number of
them were seen to have come from this firm of solicitors.''<
He said even the shed was full of black plastic bags.<
Police also found a copy of a judgment from a High Court hearing in which the
defendant had been told by a judge ``in no uncertain terms that he should not go
about collecting confidential waste,'' Mr Brown said.<
Pell admitted a charge of theft from Harkavys Solicitors on February 26.<
Four other counts of theft were ordered to remain on file.<
Eamon Sherry, defending, said: ``This is plainly a sad case because it is
quite clear that Mr Pell has a debilitating illness and has plainly got an
obsession with waste and rubbish.''<
He said the illness was not treatable, and asked the court to defer sentencing
his client while a psychiatrist's report was drawn up.<
Agreeing to defer sentence to December 10, Judge Christopher Hordern QC, said:
``Though I do not make it a condition, it seems to me that it would be as well
for your client to get rid of every other piece of paper that he has collected
in this way before I come to sentence him.''<
He added: ``It may seem on the face of it minor, but this is very much more
serious. I have to tell you that every sentence option is available to the
courts.''<
Pell was granted bail on condition that he resided at his home address and
stuck to a night time curfew.<
