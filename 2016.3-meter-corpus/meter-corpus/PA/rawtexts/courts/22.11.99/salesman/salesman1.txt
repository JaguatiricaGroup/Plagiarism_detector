CAR SALESMAN JAILED AFTER HIGH SPEED DEATH CRASH<
By Charis Owen, PA News<
A car salesman who caused the death of a young doctor after travelling at
speeds approaching 90 mph during a test drive on a winding country road was
today sentenced to nine months in prison.<
David Goodwin, 36, who lost control while showing off a Subaru Impreza Turbo
sports car to potential buyer, 29-year-old Dr David McBeath, was also
disqualified from driving for three years.<
Goodwin, a former prison officer from Glendoick, Perthshire, who had
previously pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, stood with his
head bowed in the dock as the sentence was read out at Perth Sheriff Court.<
Sheriff Fiona Reith said she had taken into account Goodwin's guilty plea,
previous good driving record, and the fact that he had formerly worked as a
prison officer, when deciding on an appropriate sentence.<
She said: ``However, the fact remains that you drove in a manner that showed a
complete disregard to the lives of other road users, including your passenger Dr
McBeath.<
``I am told by the Crown that you were driving the car excessively fast
apparently as a means of showing off the performance of the vehicle, without
being asked to do so.<
``It was the manner in which you chose to drive that vehicle that led you to
lose control of the vehicle.<
``This really must have been an horrific experience, and it had the worst
possible consequences for your passenger Dr McBeath and his wife and family.''<
Sheriff Reith said car drivers had to learn that driving dangerously would not
be tolerated and added: ``The punishment in this case cannot be other than
imprisonment.''<
Outside the court following the sentencing, Dr McBeath's father, Malcolm
McBeath, said: ``No sentence, whatever the severity, would make up for the loss
of our son.<
``We cannot help feeling angry and bitter about the circumstances of his
death. It's a waste of a young life.<
``His work as a GP was by all accounts well respected by patients and
colleagues and he could have benefited so many people in his life time.''<
The court had earlier heard that Dr McBeath, a married GP of Gallowhill
Gardens, Kinross, had gone with a friend to Anderson Cars showroom in Perth on
May 18 this year to test drive the #21,000 sports car before coming to a
decision about buying it.<
Goodwin drove the car perfectly normally until they reached a country road.<
The court heard he began to drive excessively fast, although he had not been
requested to go at such a speed.<
After skidding round one bend, Goodwin lost control at a second twist in the
road where he skidded across the carriageway and into an oncoming BMW.<
The Subaru left the ground, flipped over and ended up in an adjacent field.<
Accident investigators said they believed the car was doing between 81mph and
89mph at the point of impact.<
Goodwin, who suffered a broken leg and ribs in the crash, has since been
dismissed from Anderson Cars.<
During an earlier court appearance he asked for a letter of apology to Dr
McBeath's family to be read out in which he expressed his remorse over the
tragedy.<
Defence counsel Sandy Bolland QC, said his client, who previously had a clean
driving record, had suffered post-traumatic amnesia and could not remember the
crash nor account for the manner of his driving that day.<
