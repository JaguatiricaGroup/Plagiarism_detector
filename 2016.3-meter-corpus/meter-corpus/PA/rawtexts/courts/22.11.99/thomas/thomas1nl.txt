By Brian Farmer, PA News<
Schoolboy Thomas Marshall was strangled to death by a homosexual village
shopkeeper with whom he was sexually involved, a jury heard today.<
Kevan Roberts, 52, may have feared that 12-year-old Thomas was about to expose
their illegal relationship, Norwich Crown Court was told.<
Thomas vanished after cycling away from his home in Happisburgh, Norfolk,
early in the evening of November 21, 1997.<
His body was found 50 miles away _ in a picnic area used as a meeting place by
homosexual men _ at Roudham Heath near Thetford, Norfolk, 24 hours later.<
Roberts, who ran a general store in Eccles near Happisburgh, denies murder and
says he was not having any sexual relationship with Thomas.<
