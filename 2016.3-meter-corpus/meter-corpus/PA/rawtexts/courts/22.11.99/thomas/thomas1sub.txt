SHOPKEEPER STRANGLED BOY, 12, COURT TOLD<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
A 12-year-old boy was strangled to death by a shop keeper who he was sexually
involved with, a court heard today.<
Thomas Marshall vanished from his home in Happisburgh, Norfolk, in August
1997, Norwich Crown Court was told.<
His body was found 50 miles away in a picnic area near Thetford Norfolk, 24
hours later.<
Kevan (correct) Roberts, 52, who ran a general store in Eccles, Norfolk, at
the time of Thomas's death, denies murder.<
 Charles Wide QC, prosecuting, told the jury of eight men and four women that
Thomas lived with his parents Carol and John near the beach in Happisburgh.<
Roberts, 52, ran a shop on an estate in the neighbouring village of Eccles.<
''They (Thomas and Roberts) got to know each other in May or June of 1997.
Something sexual developed between them,'' said Mr Wide .<
''In the early evening of August 21, 1997 Thomas left home on his bicycle
saying he was going to see a friend.<
''The Crown stated that he was going to see Mr Roberts and Mr Roberts was
expecting him.''<
Mr Wide said Thomas was probably dead within about three hours of leaving
home. The Crown's case was that Roberts had strangled the youngster, said Mr
Wide.<
His bike was found in a secluded area of woodland about five miles from
Happisburgh on the day after he vanished.<
A few hours later his body was discovered at Roudham Heath near Thetford a few
hours after that.<
''Thomas was wearing a bootlace type necklace,'' said Mr Wide. ``You may
conclude after hearing the evidence that he was strangled from behind. His
collar and the necklace being seized and twisted.''<
Mr Wide said two beads on Thomas's necklace were missing when his body was
found.<
A police officer had found a bead similar to the missing beads in a sink trap
underneath Robert's sink 13 months after Thomas went missing.<
''The Crown say that it is one of the beads which fell off when the necklace
was broken in the act of strangulation,'' added Mr Wide.<
Mr Roberts was not able to explain how the bead had got there.<
