  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles Wide QC, prosecuting, told the jury of eight men and four women that
Thomas was strangled with a shoelace necklace he wore.<
Two tiny beads from the necklace were missing when police found the
youngster's body.<
A bead matching one of those on the necklace was found stuck in the u-bend
under a sink in the flat at the back of Roberts' shop 13 months after Thomas's
death, the court heard.<
Roberts, who admitted to police that he found adolescent boys attractive but
said he had never had a sexual relationship with such a boy, had also told a
prisoner about his involvement with Thomas, while on remand awaiting trial, the
court heard.<
He had said he ``hated'' Thomas because the youngster was ``taking over his
life'' and having it ``both ways'', Mr Wide told the jury.<
Marks around Thomas's groin also indicated that he might have been sexually
interfered with shortly before his death.<
And both Thomas and Roberts appeared to have made secretive arrangements for
the night of August 21.<
Thomas had said he had arranged to visit a friend _ yet no such arrangement
had been made.<
