Mr Wide added: ``During the course of the inquiry Mr Roberts was open with the
police about being a homosexual who was attracted to adolescent boys.<
``Although he also said that he never had a relationship with such a boy.''<
He said Thomas had been introduced to Roberts by a friend in May or June of
1997.<
The friend had told police that he and Thomas used to steal cigarettes and
tobacco from Roberts' shop with one distracting Roberts while the other stole.<
``On one occasion when they went to the shop, Thomas asked Mr Roberts if he
was gay and Mr Roberts said he was,'' added Mr Wide.<
``During the summer of 1997 Thomas went to the shop (and) something of a
sexual nature happened between Mr Roberts and Thomas.<
''Precisely what, the prosecution cannot say. Only two people were present and
one of them is dead.<
``You may however come to the conclusion that Thomas was street-wise enough to
try to exploit the situation but not so mature as to realise what he might be
getting himself into.''<
Roberts had told police that Thomas and other boys had become more confident
as they continued to visit the shop and had been ``cheeky, rude and a
nuisance''.<
He told detectives that he had tried to discourage the boys from visiting but
at times felt he was ``losing control''.<
