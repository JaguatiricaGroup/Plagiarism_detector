  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roberts, who was having a homosexual relationship with his cousin Peter Roberts,
a married father from Thetford, had lied about going out.<
He had told Peter Roberts not to visit him on the evening of Thomas's
disappearance because he would not be in. But he had answered the telephone at
8pm on August 21, when Peter called.<
And a policeman found Roberts ``wide awake'' with his hair ``neatly combed''
when he called at the shop at 3am on August 22 while searching for Thomas.<
``They (Thomas and Roberts) got to know each other in May or June of 1997.
Something sexual developed between them,'' said Mr Wide.<
``Thomas had plainly arranged to meet someone. This defendant, Kevan Roberts,
had plainly arranged to meet someone. The crown's case is that they arranged to
meet each other.<
``It was during that meeting, perhaps because something happened to make Mr
Roberts fear that Thomas would tell others about what had been going on between
them, that Kevan Roberts killed Thomas by strangling him.''<
The court heard how Thomas and his friend Adrian Smith, now 18 and also of
Eccles, regularly visited Roberts' shop.<
Mr Smith said they would steal cigarettes, ``wind up'' Roberts about his
sexuality and discuss drug-taking.<
Roberts told police that Thomas was a ``nuisance'' who could be ``cheeky and
rude''. But he denied making advances towards him or touching him in any way.<
Mr Wide said Roberts had been more detailed about his involvement with Thomas
when speaking to prisoner Roy Reynolds while on remand.<
Roberts had told Reynolds, who is serving a life sentence for serious sexual
offence against young boys, that he had ``come close to admitting murder''.<
``Mr Roberts told Mr Reynolds enough about Thomas for it to be apparent that
something sexual had occurred between them,'' said Mr Wide.<
``Mr Reynolds said he had made the mistake of having oral sex with (a) boy.
This defendant told Reynolds that the situation was the same with Thomas _
saying something like, `once that happens you are over a barrel'.<
``He explained that this was why Thomas was taking over his life. He said he
hated Thomas and thought that Thomas had it both ways _ getting his pleasure and
his money.''<
Mr Wide added: ``Mr Roberts told Mr Reynolds he came very close to admitting
murder _ indicating with his thumb and forefinger a very small gap.''<
He said Thomas was ``old for his age'' and had a ``strong independent
streak''.<
``Superficially he was streetwise,'' added Mr Wide. ``Something of a sexual
nature happened between Mr Roberts and Thomas.<
``Precisely what, the prosecution cannot (say). Only two people were present
and one of them is dead.<
``You may come to the conclusion that Thomas was streetwise enough to try and
exploit the situation but not mature enough to realise what he was getting
himself into.''<
