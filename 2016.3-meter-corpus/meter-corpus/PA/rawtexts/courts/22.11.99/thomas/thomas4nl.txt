  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Wide said police had traced the Hong Kong makers of the beads on Thomas's
necklace and established that the bead found in the sink trap was very similar.<
He said Roberts could offer no explanation for the presence of the bead when
questioned, adding: ``The prosecution case is that the bead that was found in
the sink trap is one of the beads from Thomas's necklace and that it came off in
the very act of killing him.''<
Mr Wide said Roberts would also have been familiar with the isolated woodland
clearing near Happisburgh when Thomas's dismantled bike was found on the day his
body was discovered.<
Thomas's parents, John and Carol, sat at the back of the court holding hands
with their heads bowed during the case.<
Giving evidence, Mrs Marshall told how Thomas should have been home by 9.30pm
on the night he vanished. She said she and her husband had searched his
favourite haunts and visited his friends in a vain attempt to find him.<
Mr Wide said post mortem tests showed that the youngster had probably died
with three hours of leaving home at 5.30pm.<
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.<
