  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Wide said that while on remand in prison awaiting trial, Roberts met a
prisoner named Roy Reynolds, who was serving a life sentence for serious sexual
offences against young boys.<
Roberts had discussed Thomas with Reynolds on a number of occasions.<
``Mr Roberts told Mr Reynolds enough about Thomas for it to be apparent that
something sexual had occurred between them (Roberts and Thomas),'' said Mr Wide.
   ``Mr Roberts told Mr Reynolds he came very close to admitting murder,
indicating with his thumb and forefinger a very small gap.''<
Mr Wide said Roberts asked a neighbour to provide him with cannabis for the
evening of August 21, telling the neighbour that he was expecting to be visited
by a friend.<
He said Roberts was also having a homosexual relationship with his cousin
Peter Roberts, a married father who lived in Thetford.<
Peter Roberts had wanted to visit Kevan Roberts on the evening of August 21
but Kevan Roberts had put him off, saying he was going out.<
Mr Wide said Roberts would have been familiar with the isolated woodland
common where Thomas's bike was found because he drove past the spot regularly on
his way to buy eggs.<
The picnic area where Thomas's body was found was a known meeting place for
homosexuals.<
Forensic tests of the contents of Thomas' stomach indicated that he probably
died within three hours of leaving home on August 21.<
