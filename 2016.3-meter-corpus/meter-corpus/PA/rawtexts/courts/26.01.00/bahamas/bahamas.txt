STUDENT WAS `BURNED, RAPED THEN STRANGLED'<
A British tourist found dead near a beach in the Bahamas was strangled after
being beaten, burned and raped, a court heard.<
American pathologist Cyril Wecht performed the autopsy in Nassau on
24-year-old Joanne Clarke, a college student from Banbury, Oxfordshire.<
Her bruised and bloody body was found on August 22, 1998 on Paradise Island a
day after her disappearance.<
A 19-year-old Bahamian man, Tennel McIntosh, is accused of killing Clarke and
another tourist, schoolteacher Lori Fogleman of Richmond, Virginia, and leaving
the bodies near popular Cabbage Beach.<
McIntosh is also charged with raping Clarke.<
Wecht said on Tuesday he found evidence that Clarke was hit over the head with
a blunt object, burned on her thighs with what could have been a cigarette and
had injuries consistent with rape.<
Injuries around her neck pointed to the actual cause of death, he said.<
``In my opinion Miss Clarke died of asphyxiation due to manual
strangulation,'' Wecht said.<
Prosecutor Cheryl Bethel has promised to present DNA evidence and 22 witnesses
during the trial.<
Clarke was visiting a local family in Nassau, the Bahamian capital, and was
left at the Paradise Island beach on August 21, 1998.<
When a friend returned to pick her up a few hours later, she was nowhere to be
found.<
A search by police and friends led to the discovery of her body and that of
Fogleman, who had disappeared on July 20, 1998, while visiting Paradise Island.<
The trial was adjourned until today.<
