MOTHERS CAN BLOCK PATERNITY TESTS, JUDGE RULES<
Mothers can legally object to children giving blood samples in paternity
cases, a High Court judge ruled today.<
The decision could be a dramatic setback for men who want to prove their
status _ and, according to the judge in the case, the law as it stands ``does
not serve the best interests of children''.<
Mr Justice Wall ruled in the High Court Family Division that when there are
disputes over parentage the law gives men the right to obtain orders for the use
of DNA blood tests.<
But mothers can legally object to blood being taken if they have care and
control of their child.<
He said that if the situation was to be changed it was for Parliament to
change it, adding: ``If Parliament does not implement reform, the law in this
area will continue not to serve the best interests of children.''<
The judge held in two test cases that, where men had obtained orders for blood
samples to be taken under the provisions of the Family Law Reform Act 1969, the
mothers did not legally have to consent.<
In a complex 35-page judgment, he said both mothers were within their legal
rights to refuse.<
The power of the courts to require use of blood tests was contained in Part
III of the 1969 Act.<
However, the Act also stipulated that a blood sample could be taken from a
child under the age of 16 ``if the person who has the care and control of it
consents''.<
The judge said that, although he found the proposition ``unattractive'', he
was satisfied that the provisions for courts to order blood tests were
``entirely over-ridden'' by the other provisions entitling the parent with care
and control to refuse consent for blood to be taken.<
The judge said: ``I am of the view that the court has no jurisdiction to
compel either of the mothers in the instant case to give their consent to
samples being taken of their respective children's blood.''<
