DANCER SUES NHS TRUST OVER HEART ATTACK `PANIC'<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
Top dancer Kerstin Parkin, whose career ended after she suffered catastrophic
brain damage during the birth of her first child, began an #8 million damages
claim against an NHS trust today.<
High Court judge Mr Justice Buckley was shown a video of Kerstin dancing with
her husband Mark when they were leaders in Latin American dance competitions,
followed by footage of her being treated in a hospital bed.<
The stunning brunette must now spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair or
bed, cannot talk and has to have 24-hour care.<
Her husband, who gave up his career to look after her, has settled his
#800,000 claim for post-traumatic stress against Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust for
an undisclosed sum.<
John Grace QC, representing the pair, said the event that ``devastated their
lives'' came when Kerstin was 27 and in labour during the birth of her first
child at Farnborough Hospital, near Orpington, Kent.<
She suffered a fit which led to cardiac arrest and needed ``basic first
aid''.<
``The midwife did none of the right things. It seems that effectively a panic
state ensued among the staff.<
``No-one called for assistance for at least four minutes and there were no
attempts at resuscitation for five or six minutes.''<
When a cardiac arrest crash team was called, they did not know the code to
open the ward door and more time was wasted, he said.<
``Once they got round to doing the obvious, her heart started easily.''<
But this was around 20 minutes after the heart attack, according to hospital
records.<
