Mr Grace said: ``The result of the catalogue of errors was that Kerstin Parkin
suffered profound brain damage which had a severe psychological effect on her
husband.<
``It destroyed two successful careers in the world of international dance,
devastated their family life and will mean lifelong therapy and care for
Kerstin.''<
He said the pair danced professionally and her husband was for eight years
ranked among the top six in his field in the world.<
They met when Kerstin travelled to the UK from her native Germany to study
dancing. They became dancing partners and married in 1989.<
They decided in 1994 to give up the international dance scene to concentrate
on the ``more lucrative'' business of teaching and choreography and start a
family, said Mr Grace.<
``It was a very strong relationship,'' said Mr Grace. ``It is as strong now as
it ever was before these disastrous events.''<
He said that during their career they enjoyed ``an enviable lifestyle'' of
international travel, horse riding and skiing.<
``They were looking forward to a new area in their lives but instead they have
to look for lifelong support.''<
Their son, Dylan, who is now three, is being looked after by family, friends
and full-time nannies at a cost so far of #25,000.<
Kerstin is now at a rehabilitation unit in Godalming, Surrey, where her
husband visits her every day to help with her therapy and swims with her in the
pool.<
