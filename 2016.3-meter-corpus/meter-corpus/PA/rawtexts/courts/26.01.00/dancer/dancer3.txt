He has just moved into a flat at Bramley Grange Hotel in Bramley, Surrey, paid
for with an interim payment from Bromley NHS trust which has admitted liability
for Kerstin's condition but disputes the amount of damages.<
  Her 41-year-old husband wants to care for Kerstin at home but the hospital
trust says she should go to a nursing home.<
Mr Grace said: ``One of the remarkable features of this case is that not a
single expert on the defendant's side has examined Kerstin. One wonders how any
expert can sensibly say he or she has made an assessment of the needs of a
patient like this without having carried out an examination.''<
He said Kerstin had learned to operate a computer using a laser beam strapped
to her head, where she does have some movement.<
``She tries to communicate using eye movement and facial expressions because
she cannot speak. Kerstin often cries loudly because of what could be her pain
or because of her mental anguish.<
``She was from the world of dance and loves to watch dancing on television and
listen to music.''<
He said her mental condition was difficult to assess because she cannot
communicate, but she was ``alert and responsive'' and responded to humour,
especially in her native tongue, German.<
