Mr Parkin told the court that he spent the first two-and-a-half weeks after her
heart attack with his 31-year-old wife in intensive care.<
``I was there 24 hours a day _ sometimes I slept on seats at the hospital and
sometimes the nurses made up a spare bed for me in a ward.<
``I read to her from magazines and sometimes played her music. She was trying
to open her eyes but the response was minimal.''<
He added: ``My feelings at the time were that I was to blame. It was essential
for me to reassure her because I didn't know whether she could hear me at
all.''<
When she moved back to Farnborough hospital he bought her a TV and video and
she gradually became more aware.<
At the rehabilitation centre, he said at first he was with her from 7.30 in
the morning until 10.30 at night with short breaks to make sure Dylan was all
right.<
``I was still hoping that everything would turn around and be OK.''<
He then became more involved in her therapy and decorated her hotel room with
wildlife pictures and pictures of her friends to provide stimulus.<
But because of shortage of money, after 18 months he was forced to return to
live in Croydon and faced a three-hour car journey every time he wanted to visit
his wife.<
``I think she responded well to my company. That is why I want to be with her
all the time.''<
He now takes her on trips in her wheelchair around Guildford and to the local
pub.<
Mr Parkin said he was ``not completely happy'' with her treatment at the
moment. His wife had to be fed through her stomach and attempts to try to teach
her to feed through her mouth ``had not been consistent'' because therapists do
not stay long at Unsted Park.<
Asked by Mr Grace whether he believed he could communicate with his wife, he
replied: ``When she is happy she gives a beautiful smile and when she is sad she
cries.<
``She tries hard to communicate. She blinks and opens her mouth for `yes' and
her eyes go back and forth and she shakes her head for `no'.<
``She is mesmerised by Dylan and he is there most days. He is the one who can
get the closest to her physically. She allows him to touch her face and wipe her
mouth when she dribbles.''<
He says his son is always very happy to see his mother and does not see her
disability as something to question at the moment.<
Mr Parkin said he wanted to care for his wife in their own home because he
wanted ``to be a husband again and a father''.<
``Do you think you can cope with the pressures in that situation?'' asked Mr
Grace.<
``Yes I am sure. It would be like living as a family again. I would be able to
sit down to breakfast in the morning with her and when it was time for lunch, I
would not have to leave the hospital as I do now.<
``I want to take her out on more outings and find entertaining and interesting
things for her to do.''<
He said the thought that she must spend the rest of her life in a nursing home
was a ``horror scenario'', adding: ``She has lost so much already. I don't see
why she must suffer like that for the rest of her life.''<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
