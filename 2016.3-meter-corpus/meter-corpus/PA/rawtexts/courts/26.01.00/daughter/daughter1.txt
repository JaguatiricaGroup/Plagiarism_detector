MOTHER WINS RIGHT TO HAVE DAUGHTER STERILISED<
A mother has won a legal battle for the right for her ``attractive'' but
mentally handicapped daughter to undergo a hysterectomy to protect her from
unwanted pregnancy.<
The 54-year-old mother, a widow, claimed the operation was the most effective
way for her 28-year-old daughter to be fully protected from an unwanted
pregnancy.<
In opposition, Official Solicitor Laurence Oates said the hysterectomy was
unnecessary.<
Tonight Mencap went one further and condemned the operation as ``an extreme
measure'' based on social not health grounds.<
David Congdon, director of public affairs for Mencap said: ``Mencap believes
that a hysterectomy is only in a person's best interests if based on health
rather then social grounds.<
``Although such cases are difficult, the judge seems to have placed excessive
emphasis on social concerns and we can see little medical justification for such
an extreme measure.<
``Whilst we respect the mother's anxiety, a judgement based on a fear for what
might happen in the future would not necessarily be acting in her daughter's
best interests.''<
In making the landmark judgment, one of the country's senior High Court family
judges, Mr Justice Wall, overruled objections by Mr Oates, who acts for those
not capable of looking after their own legal interests, and said that the
operation can go ahead in the interests of the daughter.<
The judge said that the daughter, identified only by the initial S, though an
``extremely attractive young woman'' was incapable of managing and administering
her own affairs.<
Although she attends a day centre five days a week she is currently cared for
by her mother. But the mother is finding coping increasingly difficult and it is
hoped that within 12 months S will get a permanent placement at an appropriate
home.<
The judge said the mother was anxious that away from her close and careful
supervision, S, who he said he had been shown photographs of, would form an
emotional attachment with a man, resulting in sexual intercourse and pregnancy.<
He continued: ``Or, and this I think is the real anxiety, that in what the
mother described as `this cruel world', S may become pregnant as a result of a
man either taking advantage of her or raping her.''<
It was common ground among all who had examined or come into contact with S
that pregnancy would be disastrous for her, he said.<
``She would have no understanding of what was happening to her. She would be
completely unable to care for a child. The whole process would be frightening
and traumatic for her,'' he said.<
``The experts are unanimous that it would be highly detrimental to S's welfare
were she to become pregnant. She would not understand the process.''<
Another reason the mother sought a hysterectomy rather than sterilisation was
that S suffered from heavy periods which she did not understand, and a
hysterectomy would solve both problems.<
