He said that in opposing the move the Official Solicitor had argued that there
was no indication in S's lifestyle to suggest any change in her attitude towards
men. <
She had an obsession with cleanliness and bodily functions and it was argued
that she was unlikely to find sex either attractive or pleasurable.<
``The Official Solicitor also argues that when S leaves home she is likely to
live in single-sex accommodation and the level of supervision in her life will
be sufficiently high to make it unlikely that she will be subjected to an
involuntary or non-consensual act of sexual intercourse.<
``He argues that the risk of pregnancy is speculative, and that there is
insufficient evidence for the court to find that there is an identifiable
risk,'' said the judge.<
However, he said that though the point was ``finely balanced'' he considered
there was an identifiable risk of pregnancy. <
While in her mother's day-to-day care the risk was remote, but the situation
would change if she left home. <
The absence of her mother would inevitably reduce the level of supervision and
``increase her vulnerability to an exploitive relationship''.<
It would also increase the probability that S, who despite her disabilities
enjoys social activities including swimming and horse riding, would seek
affection from others.<
Ruling that the hysterectomy could go ahead the judge said: ``In my judgment
the court is entitled to declare lawful a particular course of treatment if that
treatment is itself proper and in the interests of the patient.''<
``I am of the clear view that it is in S's best interests for her periods to
come to an end and for the risk of pregnancy to be wholly removed,'' he said.<
``I do not underestimate the effects of surgery on S, but take into account
that if the operation is performed in the near future and before she moves to
sheltered accommodation, her mother will be available to be with her and to help
her through the process.''<
He said that the likely effects of surgery on S were not such as to render it
contrary to her interests and there were substantial benefits which would
``enhance the quality of her life''.<
He said that in those circumstances his view was that the proposed therapeutic
``laparoscopic hysterectomy'' was the ``preferred option''<
The judge gave leave for the Official Solicitor to appeal.<
