SHIPMAN JURY SENT HOME FOR THIRD NIGHT<
By Peter Beal, PA News<
The jury in the Harold Shipman trial was tonight sent home for a third night
without returning any verdicts on the 15 murder charges against him.<
The seven men and five women had spent a total of just over 17 hours
considering their verdicts when the judge, Mr Justice Forbes, told them to cease
their deliberations and return tomorrow. They first retired at Preston Crown
Court on Monday morning.<
Shipman, 54, of Roe Cross Green, Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, is
accused of murdering the 15 middle-aged and elderly patients with heroin
injections between March 1995 and June 1998 and forging the #386,000 will of one
of them, Kathleen Grundy, 81.<
The judge told the jury: ``It is very important that you should not feel under
any sort of pressure whether from time or anything else.<
``And it is very important you should not become unduly fatigued during the
course of your deliberations in this case. So I have come to the conclusion you
should not deliberate further today.''<
