FATHER `DISGUSTED' AT DEATH DRIVER'S FOUR-MONTH JAIL TERM <
The father of a girl knocked down and left to die by a driver who ``drank
himself into oblivion to obliterate the memory of what had occurred'' said he
was ``disgusted'' at the sentence the motorist received today.<
The driver James Billman, 22, of William Way, Toftwood, Dereham, Norfolk, was
sentenced to four months in prison and banned him from driving for two years by
Norwich magistrates today.<
Norman Yeomans, said the family was still trying to come to terms with what
happened the night his 15-year-old daughter, Lorna, was killed on a Norwich
road.<
``I am very disgusted with what amounts to two months in prison for killing my
daughter,'' said Mr Yeomans referring to the length of the sentence Billman will
serve.<
Lorna died just 300 yards from her home shortly after 9pm at the scene of the
accident in Drayton High Road, Norwich, on October 9 last year.  <
Prosecutor Nick Methold told the court that Billman had carried on drinking
the next day and had gone to the police station 30 hours later. <
Billman admitted failing to stop after an accident; failing to report an
accident and making a false statement to get insurance by not revealing he had
previously been banned from driving in October 96 for 18 months.<
The magistrates had heard at an earlier hearing that Billman had said he had
drunk four pints of lager in the Cock Inn at Drayton the afternoon before the
accident and had later returned there but there was no evidence he had drunk any
more. He was on his way into Norwich when he hit Lorna who was with some
friends.<
Sentencing him stipendiary magistrate Patrick Healey said: ``The only sentence
I can pass is one of imprisonment. <
``There has been no criticism of your driving. <
``There are three reasons why custody is inevitable - the first is you failed
to stop and it was a fatal accident which the police had to investigate; the
second reason is it was impossible for the police to trace the alcohol in your
system at the time and third you left a young girl to her fate who you had
knocked down without taking any steps to help her.''<
Christopher Brown, defending Billman said: ``He deeply regrets what happened.
Threats have been made to his family. He is very remorseful, is under his GP and
is having counselling. <
``He was not speeding and was on his correct side of the road. He was not
aware of an impending accident. He does not wish for any sympathy and does not
deserve any. <
``After the accident he went to a night-club where he knew his friends would
not be and in the darkness drank himself into oblivion to obliterate the memory
of what had occurred. The most difficult part is the knowledge that he will have
to live with what he did on that night.''<
Mr Yeomans said Billman had never expressed any remorse to his family before
today's court action. He said the family was also taking advice about civil
proceedings.<
