NO POISON SUPPLY AT AUSCHWITZ, CLAIMS HISTORIAN<
By Jan Colley, PA News<
Eye-witness evidence of the existence of homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz
was ``totally demolished'' because there were no holes in the roof through which
to insert poison, historian David Irving told the High Court today.<
Mr Irving, the 62-year-old author of Hitler's War, who is seeking libel
damages for being called a ``Holocaust denier'', said that his theory ``blows
holes in the whole gas chambers story''.<
He said that a number of ``revisionist'' researchers had entered the ruins of
Crematorium Two at Auschwitz, in which Holocaust historians say 500,000 died,
and photographed the collapsed underside of the roof _ but found no holes.<
``I do not accept that the Nazis in the last frantic days of the camp, when
they were in a blue funk, would have gone around with buckets of cement filling
the holes that they were going to dynamite.''<
Mr Irving, who is representing himself, made the comments during his
cross-examination of Professor Robert van Pelt, who has said that there was a
``massive amount of evidence'' of the camp's use for mass extermination.<
Prof van Pelt has said that the gas chambers were first dismantled and then
dynamited when the gassings stopped in November 1944 as the Russians advanced.<
Giving evidence for American academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin books, who
are fighting Mr Irving's action, he says that the evidence for gassing included
eye-witness accounts, photos and drawings from memory of a sonderkommando _ a
Jewish inmate selected to work in the crematoria.<
He referred Mr Justice Gray to a photo taken by an SS man in February 1943
which showed openings above ground on the newly-completed roof of Crematorium
Two with a kind of cover on top of them.<
The defence case is that these projections were from four introduction columns
through which Zyklon B pellets travelled.<
Mr Irving, who says that the gas chambers were only used to de-louse corpses
and objects, claimed that the picture was taken in December 1942 during building
works and that the objects on the roof were drums containing sealant.<
Prof van Pelt also relied on an aerial photo taken by the Americans in the
summer of 1944 which showed ``four dots'' on the roof of Crematorium Two.<
He said that this showed very clearly that there were ``introduction devices''
on top of the building.<
Mr Irving questioned the authenticity of the photo and said that whatever the
dots were, they were too big for the purpose put forward by the defence.<
Prof van Pelt also cited the drawings, undertaken in 1945-46, of surviving
sonderkommando David Olere, which showed openings for the introduction of the
pellets into the gas chamber at Crematorium Three in Auschwitz.<
Olere, he said, was a ``very experienced draughtsman and painter'' who had a
good visual memory and was a credible witness.<
The professor dismissed as ``irrelevant'' Mr Irving's contention that Olere's
``mental balance'' was compromised by his ``prurient interest'' in the female
form.<
He said: ``If you were to judge the ability of someone to bear witness on the
basis of their interest in the female form, I don't think many people would be
able to give evidence.''<
Mr Irving argued that the inclusion in the sketches of nubile naked women
meant that they were intended to be marketable and were therefore unreliable.<
Mr Irving is suing over Prof Lipstadt's 1994 book, Denying The Holocaust: The
Growing Assault On Truth And Memory.<
Accused by the defendants of being ``a liar and a falsifier of history'', he
depends on a 1988 report by a man called Fred Leuchter, who had taken samples
from ruins at Auschwitz and concluded that there were never homicidal gas
chambers there.<
Mr Irving says Prof Lipstadt's book has generated ``waves of hatred'' against
him.<
