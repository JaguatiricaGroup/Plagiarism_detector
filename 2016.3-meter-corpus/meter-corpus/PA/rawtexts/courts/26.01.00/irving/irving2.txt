  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Irving said that the defence's ``so-called'' eye witnesses were a relatively
small number for the large proposition at stake.<
Apart from that, he added, there was not ``a single document of any credible
worth'' which explicitly set out the defence case in all the ``hundreds of
thousands'' of papers in the Auschwitz museum and the Moscow archives.<
He submitted that his position on the Holocaust was justifiable and not
perverse.<
He went on to question Professor van Pelt's reliance on the evidence of
sonderkommando Henryk Tauber which included descriptions of gassings in
Auschwitz's crematoria.<
He said that some of Tauber's accounts ``test a reasonable historian's
credulity'' and ``should be open to more than normal scrutiny''.<
He read out a description of an event in August 1944 in Crematorium Five at
Auschwitz when a gold watch and wedding ring were found on a 20-year-old Jewish
labourer called Lejb.<
Tauber told how in front of all the sonderkommandos, Lejb was hung from an
iron bar above the firing hearths before being thrown into a cold crematorium
furnace, which was then lit.<
Lejb was released, covered in burns, and ordered to run around the yard
shouting that he was a thief.<
Finally, he was made to climb the barbed wire, which was not electrified
during the day, and was shot when he reached the top.<
Tauber also described how the SS chased another prisoner into a pit near the
crematorium that was full of boiling human fat before he was pulled out still
alive and shot.<
Asked by Mr Irving if this ``lurid'' story was plausible, Prof van Pelt said
that it was.<
Mr Irving questioned the validity of Tauber's evidence as he had wrongly
asserted that four million had died at Auschwitz.<
Prof van Pelt said that he considered that Tauber was ``an absolutely
amazingly good witness''.<
``I find his power of observation very precise and don't have any general
reason to doubt his credibility as a witness''.<
Mr Irving suggested that at the time of his evidence Tauber would have been
furnished with drawings and documents by the interrogating Polish authorities.<
