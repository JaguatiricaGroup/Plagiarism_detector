Prof van Pelt said that the design for Crematorium Two at Auschwitz was unique
in the history of such buildings.<
``It was of a size and a capacity which has absolutely no precedent at all and
has never been followed by one of that size ever.''<
He said that the corpses were carried in small batches from the mortuary to
the furnaces via one elevator measuring about eight feet by five feet.<
Prof van Pelt disputed Mr Irving's suggestion that the number said to have
died in the gas chambers was ``inflated'' as moving so many bodies would have
created a ``bottle-neck in an hour-glass''.<
He said that it would not be so if ``you want the sand to go through in an
hour rather than an instant''.<
Mr Irving went on to question the defence's assertion that he was ``a
danger''.<
``To what or whom am I being dangerous? ... I'm not a member of the IRA. I
don't go around blowing up cars.''<
He said that the only interpretation he could put on such a claim was that he
was a danger to those who had turned the Holocaust into a ``lucrative
business''.<
The hearing was adjourned until Friday.<
