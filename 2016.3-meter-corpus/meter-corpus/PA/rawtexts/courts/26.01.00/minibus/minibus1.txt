LORRY DRIVER TELLS OF `NIGHTMARE' SINCE FATAL CRASH<
By Gordon Darroch, PA News<
The driver of a lorry involved in a collision which killed five members of a
pub football team, hit back tearfully in court today at the suggestion that his
loss of memory of the crash was ``convenient''.<
Graham Jagger, of Windhill, Shipley, West Yorkshire, was driving on the A42
towards Tamworth, Staffordshire, on December 7, 1998, when his Volvo lorry
ploughed into the back of the bus, which was experiencing engine problems.<
The minibus was taking 17 members of the Groby Stamford pub football team on a
Christmas outing to the Snow Dome in Tamworth.<
Jagger, 46, who has denied the charge of careless driving, told Hinckley
magistrates' court that his failure to remember the accident had become a
``nightmare''. <
He said: ``The only memory I have got is hitting the support stanchion of a
bridge and trying to take avoiding action to miss it. I have got no recollection
prior to that.''<
Granville Rooley, defending, told him: ``It might be suggested that that was a
convenient loss of memory.''<
Jagger replied: ``No sir, my answers are truthful.''<
He went on: ``I can't sleep at night, I have mood swings and I am unable to
work.''<
``I have had panic attacks and I'm very emotional. Just trying to work it out,
how it happened, and not being able to explain it to myself _ it's just a
nightmare,'' he said, wiping his eyes.<
