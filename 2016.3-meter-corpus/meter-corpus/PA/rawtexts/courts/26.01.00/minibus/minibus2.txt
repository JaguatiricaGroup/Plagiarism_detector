Stephen Parker, 21, Paul Thompson, 22, Panayi Kouroushi, 30, all from Groby,
Leicestershire, Stephen Curtis, 28, of Newton Linford, Leicestershire, and
Jeremy Goodhall, 30, of Leicester Forest East, all died from injuries received
in the collision.<
Jagger denied suggestions put to him in interview that he could have been
distracted or fallen asleep at the wheel, but admitted to police that he had
been driving at 56mph, above the 50mph speed limit for HGVs.<
He said: ``I was driving within my capability of stopping. I don't drive
recklessly.''<
He had been on his way to a service area at Tamworth to park for the night
after collecting a delivery of pasta and rice from Nottingham. Tacograph records
showed he had driven for more than 13 hours that day. <
Jagger said that after the accident, his next memory was of two other lorry
drivers helping him out of his cab. <
He said: ``When the two drivers were trying to get me out of the cab I can
remember smelling an acrid smell. I have never smelled it before and I haven't
smelled it since.''<
John Burgess, prosecuting, told presiding magistrate David Meredith at the
start of the trial that Jagger had taken no action to avert the collision while
other motorists travelling at higher speeds had managed to overtake the bus
safely.<
An examination of the accident scene by police and forensic scientists showed
the lorry appeared to have hit the bus full on without braking.<
Jagger said he had not seen the bus, which was moving at an estimated speed of
25/35mph, or any tail lights at the time of the impact, which happened just
after 8pm.<
The court also heard that the bus had experienced several engine failures on
its way from Groby and several of the passengers had expressed concern that it
was unsafe.<
