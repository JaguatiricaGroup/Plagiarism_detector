Mr Burgess asked Jagger, who had suffered in the past from a sleeping disorder,
if he had fallen asleep behind the wheel at the time of the accident.<
He said: ``At best you lost concentration, at worst you fell asleep.''<
Jagger replied: ``I can't answer that.''<
Gordon MacFarlane, joint managing director of the Leeds-based McFarlane's
Transport Limited, said Jagger's 13-hour shift had been a ``standard working
day''.<
He said Jagger had told him of a speeding conviction he received in March
1997, but did not know Jagger had been treated in hospital in 1996 for sleep
apnoea.<
He said: ``I have never known him sleeping, I never had any complaints. My
office is next to the traffic office, so I can hear if there are complaints
about drivers.''<
Asked if he should have known of Jagger's medical condition, he replied: ``I
would have talked to him about it if he felt there would have been a problem.''<
Mr Burgess said: ``A sleep disorder may mean a drowsy driver and therefore a
dangerous driver, but you were never alerted to this fact by Mr Jagger.''<
Mr MacFarlane replied: ``That is correct.''<
