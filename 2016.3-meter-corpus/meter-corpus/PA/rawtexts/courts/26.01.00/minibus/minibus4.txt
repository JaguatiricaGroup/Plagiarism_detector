 Chartered engineer Ian White, who examined the damaged vehicles after the
accident, said Jagger could have been knocked out by his lorry's airbag, which
was set off by the force of the collision.<
He said: ``Mr Jagger was not wearing a seat belt and he would have moved
forward, hitting an inflating airbag or one that had just been inflated and
would have been like a brick wall.''<
Mr White added that dust produced by the bag's explosive charge could account
for the acrid smell and ``white flash'' which Jagger referred to when
interviewed by police.<
The engineer said it was impossible to tell from the damage to the lorry
whether it had hit the minibus full on or at an angle, which could indicate
whether Jagger had swerved before the crash.<
``If the angle of the lorry was five degrees towards the offside line I doubt
if you would be able to tell from the accident damage.''<
