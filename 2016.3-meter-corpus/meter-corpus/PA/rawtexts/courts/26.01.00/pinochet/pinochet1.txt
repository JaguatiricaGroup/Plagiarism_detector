CHALLENGE TO STRAW'S DECISION TO ALLOW PINOCHET HOME<
By Jo Butler, Home Affairs Correspondent, PA News<
Lawyers acting for Belgium and six human rights groups were to go to the High
Court today to challenge the Home Secretary's decision to allow former dictator
Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health grounds.<
The parties are seeking leave for a judicial review of Mr Straw's decision
that extradition proceedings against the 84-year-old should be dropped because
of his ill health.<
At the hearing before Mr Justice Maurice Kay, they will argue Mr Straw should
have given them access to the findings of a team of medical experts who examined
the general earlier this month.<
The human rights groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Redress Trust,
the Association of Relatives of the Disappeared and Justicia, also believe the
panel of experts should have included an old age psychiatrist and should have
taken longer than seven hours.<
Belgium is claiming that as one of the states seeking Pinochet's extradition,
it should have been allowed to see the medical evidence behind Mr Straw's
decision and should also be given the chance to have a Belgian doctor present at
a further examination of the general.<
At the same time, lawyers for the Government there are planning action against
the Home Secretary at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, claiming
he has breached international cooperation agreements.<
The Belgian challenge is also looking for the imposition of emergency measures
to stop the Home Secretary allowing Pinochet to leave Briton while the matter is
still before the courts.<
Belgium is trying to extradite Pinochet on the basis of claims from Chileans
living there that he was behind the jailing and killing of their relatives.<
Mr Straw, who has undertaken not make a final decision on whether to allow
Pinochet to return to Chile while the matter is before the courts in this
country, indicated today an announcement was still many days off.<
The Home Secretary has repeatedly insisted he cannot disclose details of the
medical report because they are covered by the rules of medical
confidentiality.<
Home Office sources said the Home Secretary had appealed to lawyers acting for
the general to waive the that right to privacy, but that had been rejected.<
Pinochet will remain under house arrest on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey
until the matter is resolved.<
A plane sent from Chile to bring him home is still in Bermuda awaiting a
decision by the Home Secretary.<
