STRAW DEFENDS PINOCHET ACTION<
By John Aston and Jo Butler, PA News<
Home Secretary Jack Straw today defended himself in the High Court against
allegations that he would be acting ``unlawfully and irrationally'' if he
allowed former dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health grounds
which were kept secret.<
Belgium and six human rights groups said it would be against the public
interest not to allow his opponents to know the medical reasons and have an
opportunity to mount legal challenges to block the general's departure.<
They accused Mr Straw of acting in breach of natural justice by refusing them
access to the confidential reports of medical experts who examined the general
earlier this month and found that he was ``simply not capable of participating
in a trial''.<
But Jonathan Sumption QC, appearing for the Home Secretary, strongly
criticised the Belgian intervention and said Amnesty and other human rights
campaigners had no legal right to be heard in extradition matters.<
The QC described how Mr Straw had ordered his own independent, impartial
report on Pinochet's health. He said it was unwelcome because it had come to a
conclusion which was favourable to the general's return home.<
He gave a warning that extraditing the 84-year-old to Spain to face charges of
torture was becoming a ``symbol of a commitment to human rights'' rather than a
legal matter which had to be properly weighed up.<
He told Mr Justice Maurice Kay: ``In a difficult situation the Secretary of
State has got the balance exactly right and there is absolutely no basis in
these applications for supposing his conclusion was perverse or in any other way
unlawful.''<
Belgium is applying for permission to seek judicial review, claiming that as
one of the states wanting Pinochet's extradition, it should have been allowed to
see the medical evidence behind Mr Straw's decision that he was ``minded'' to
allow the general to go home.<
Belgium is among the four countries, led by Spain, trying to extradite
Pinochet on the basis of claims from Chilean refugees that he was behind the
jailing and killing of their relatives.<
Belgium also contends that it should also be given the chance to have a
Belgian doctor present at a further examination of the general.<
But Mr Sumption said the Home Secretary had never invited representations from
Belgium on the Pinochet case and its letter of request was a ``diatribe''
against the decision of the Home Secretary.<
He said: ``I must be careful what I say in this court about a friendly foreign
government.<
``But there are aspects of this letter of request that are surprising.<
``This is either a collateral process to get confidential material for use in
the UK, or the Belgians have not thought it through.''<
He said there was no power for the Government to detain a man in England
while a judge in a foreign country where ``he's most unlikely to end up'' tried
to gather enough information on him.<
He added that Belgium also had no right to object to Britain stopping an
extradition request on grounds that the defendant was unfit to stand trial.<
Earlier Richard Drabble QC called for disclosure of the medical reports on
behalf of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Medical Foundation for
the Care of Victims of Torture, the Redress Trust, the Association of Relatives
of the Disappeared and Justicia.<
He said it was ``simply unacceptable'' for the Home Secretary to base
decisions on undisclosed reports as this effectively prevented people from
coming to court and ``terminated their civil rights''.<
Mr Straw had misdirected himself by failing to take proper account of the need
to protect the rights of Pinochet's alleged victims in other countries.<
Presiley Baxendale QC, appearing for Belgium, criticised the Government's
``failure'' to assure the Belgian authorities that Pinochet would not be sent
home before Britain had complied with its international legal obligations to
cooperate with other countries wanting to extradite Pinochet.<
In a court packed with the world's press, Ms Baxendale submitted that the Home
Secretary, by halting extradition proceedings, was in danger of breaching
international law and conventions.<
The QC said mutual assistance was provided-for under the 1959 European
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, under which signatories
undertook to provide each other with ``the widest measure of mutual assurance in
proceedings in respect of offences, the punishment of which falls within the
jurisdiction (of the requesting country)''.<
Mr Straw has undertaken not make a final decision on whether to allow Pinochet
to return to Chile while the current challenge is heard by the courts.<
The Home Secretary has repeatedly insisted he cannot disclose details of the
medical report because they are covered by the rules of medical
confidentiality.<
Home Office sources said Mr Straw had appealed to lawyers acting for the
general to waive the right to privacy, but that had been rejected.<
Pinochet will remain under house arrest on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey
until the matter is resolved.<
A plane sent from Chile to bring him home is still in Bermuda awaiting a
decision by the Home Secretary.<
The hearing continues tomorrow.<
