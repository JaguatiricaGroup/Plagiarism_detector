BELGIUM IN HIGH COURT BID TO PREVENT PINOCHET DEPARTURE<
By John Aston and Jo Butler, PA News<
Home Secretary Jack Straw would be acting ``unlawfully and irrationally'' if
he allowed dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health grounds
without allowing opponents to know the medical reasons and have a proper
opportunity to mount legal challenges, a High Court judge was told today.<
The accusation was made by Presiley Baxendale QC. She was applying on behalf
of Belgium for permission to seek judicial review of the Government's
``failure'' to assure the Belgian authorities that the 84-year-old would not be
sent home before Britain had complied with its international legal obligations
to co-operate with other countries wanting to extradite Pinochet.<
Both Belgium and six human-rights groups are arguing at the High Court in
London that Mr Straw should have given them access to the findings of a team of
medical experts who examined the General earlier this month.<
The human-rights groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Redress Trust,
the Association of Relatives of the Disappeared and Justicia also believe the
panel of experts should have included an old-age psychiatrist and should have
taken longer than seven hours to reach its diagnosis.<
Belgium is claiming that as one of the states seeking Pinochet's extradition,
it should have been allowed to see the medical evidence behind Mr Straw's
decision that he was ``minded'' to allow Pinochet to go home.<
Belgium also contends that it should also be given the chance to have a
Belgian doctor present at a further examination of the General.<
Belgium is trying to extradite Pinochet on the basis of claims from Chileans
living in Belgium that he was behind the jailing and killing of their
relatives.<
In a court packed with the world's press, Ms Baxendale told Mr Justice Maurice
Kay that the Home Secretary, by halting extradition proceedings, was in danger
of breaching international law and conventions.<
The QC said mutual assistance was provided-for under the 1959 European
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, under which signatories
undertook to provide each other with ``the widest measure of mutual assurance in
proceedings in respect of offences, the punishment of which falls within the
jurisdiction (of the requesting country).''<
Mr Straw has undertaken not make a final decision on whether to allow Pinochet
to return to Chile while the current challenge is heard by the courts.<
The Home Secretary has repeatedly insisted he cannot disclose details of the
medical report because they are covered by the rules of medical
confidentiality.<
Home Office sources said the Home Secretary had appealed to lawyers acting for
the General to waive the that right to privacy, but that had been rejected.<
Pinochet will remain under house arrest on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey
until the matter is resolved.<
A plane sent from Chile to bring him home is still in Bermuda awaiting a
decision by the Home Secretary.<
