           12:36 26/01/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ms Baxendale said: ``It's a breach of natural justice if Belgium could not make
meaningful representations because they couldn't see the medical records.<
``It was irrational because at one and the same time the Secretary of State
was asking Belgium to make representations and refusing to disclose the details
of the report.<
``There was no overriding principle of medical confidentiality. That was only
one factor to be taken into the balance and could be overridden by the interests
of justice.''<
Ms Baxendale dismissed an argument from lawyers acting for General Pinochet
that the case should be struck out on the grounds that no crime which would
warrant extradition to Belgium had been alleged against him.<
She said Pinochet was accused of being involved in the ``disappearance'' of
people, whose ongoing unknown whereabouts constituted a mental torture of their
relatives, and constituted an extraditable offence.<
However, the merit of the extradition case was a matter for a magistrate to
decide at an extradition hearing rather than during the present case, which was
an application for permission for a judicial review of the Home Secretary's
decision.<
The court heard that by inviting Belgium to make representations on his
decision that he was ``minded'' to drop the extradition case against Pinochet,
Mr Straw clearly accepted that the kingdom was an interested party in the case.<
Ms Baxendale said: ``The Secretary of State has invited representations but
our case is he's made it impossible for us to respond sensibly or at all to that
request because we've not been shown the document on which the `minded to come
to a decision' letter is base.<
``What your Lordship is concerned with is the complaint being made with
respect to the fact that Belgium is unable to make proper representations
although the Secretary of State has accepted that where there is to be
consultation, there is a duty on him to allow that consultation to be carried
out properly.''<
By failing to allow Belgium to put forward its case, Mr Straw was also
``disabling himself'' from making a proper decision.<
The court heard that the letter from Mr Straw asking for representations was
the first communication Belgium had had on the issue of the medical examination
of Pinochet, which was why it had not made a request in advance either to be
involved in the tests or to see a copy of the report.<
Ms Baxendale said that even now, the medical reports were being disclosed not
just to Mr Straw but to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor
General as prosecuting authorities in the UK.<
She argued that Belgium, where a prosecution case was being mounted against
the general and which was seeking to extradite him, was also a prosecuting
authority ``in a very real sense'', which gave it a right to see the reports.<
