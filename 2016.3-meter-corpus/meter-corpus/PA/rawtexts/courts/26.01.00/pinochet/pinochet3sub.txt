           12:43 26/01/00: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The court heard that the Belgian Justice Minister summoned the British
Ambassador on January 14 and requested that the medical report be made available
- in strict confidence - to a Belgian expert.<
The request was turned down three days later.<
Before the hearing proper began today, Mr Justice Kay disclosed to the court a
potential link between himself and one of the parties, Amnesty International.<
He said 10 or more years ago, it had been suggested to him that he was on a
list of counsel ``approved'' by the human rights organisation and there had once
been a suggestion of him working on a case for it.<
He said that was the ``sum detail'' of the connection, but added: ``In case
someone finds my name in a file I thought I ought to raise it now.''<
Mr Justice Kay's openness follows the unprecedented challenge to the House of
Lords' first ruling in the Pinochet case when a judgment had to be set aside
after it was disclosed one of the panel of Law Lords, Lord Hoffmann, had long
standing links with Amnesty.<
No objections were raised to the judge continuing to hear today's
application.<
Outside the court building, campaigners anxious to see the general put on
trial gathered to demonstrate.<
