           13:43 26/01/00: Page 4 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Sumption QC, appearing for the Home Secretary, rejected the Belgian
authorities contention that there had been no response to their letters of
request.<
He said there had been a response to the initial letter on January 19, and a
second letter received only a couple of days ago was still ``under
consideration''.<
Richard Drabble QC, appearing on behalf of Amnesty and the other human rights
groups opposed to Pinochet being allowed to return home, described as
``startling'' the Home Secretary's refusal to allow the medical reports to be
seen so as to allow proper, independent scrutiny of his decision.<
Mr Drabble said: ``We say the issues raised are of fundamental importance,
both as to the integrity and transparency of the international criminal justice
system, and - the matter with which we are particularly concerned - procedures
under which the rights of victims of torture are to be decided.''<
Many of the assumptions made by Mr Straw, in making a decision which could end
the hopes of victims and their families ever seeing Pinochet stand trial, were
``misconceived''.<
Mr Straw had said he was acting in a quasi-judicial role and had taken a
decision that he was ``minded'' to let Senator Pinochet go home because he was,
and would remain, unfit to stand trial.<
But the decision was based on ``difficult'' matters of medical judgment and
clinical finding which could be wrong, said Mr Drabble.<
He added: ``The proposition that there will be no scrutiny of the factual
material on which that decision is based is startling.''<
