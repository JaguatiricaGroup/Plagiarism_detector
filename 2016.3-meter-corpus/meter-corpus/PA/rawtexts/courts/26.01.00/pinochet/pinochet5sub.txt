  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Drabble said without access to the medical reports the human rights groups
had no idea even what diagnosis the medical experts had made.<
In this situation, their representations and arguments were ``shadow boxing'',
he said.<
Mr Drabble said if the Home Secretary did not have the power to force Pinochet
to undergo further medical tests, he could use his discretion to push the
general towards more openness.<
He could warn the general that unless he agreed to more tests or greater
independent scrutiny of the medical report, he, the Home Secretary, would be
minded to allow the extradition to go ahead and leave him to ``take his
chances'' on proving whether or not he was fit to stand trial when he got to
Spain.<
