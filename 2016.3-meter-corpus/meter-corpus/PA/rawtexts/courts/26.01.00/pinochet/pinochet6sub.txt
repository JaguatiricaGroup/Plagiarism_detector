           16:31 26/01/00: Page 6 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Sumption QC, acting for the Home Secretary, rejected the arguments put
forward by opposing counsel and insisted that the laws of the country invested
the authority for sanctioning extradition with the Home Secretary.<
He warned that the extradition of Pinochet was beginning to be seen by some
people as an end in itself and a symbol of a commitment to human rights, rather
than a legal matter which had to weighed up according to legal processes.<
He said: ``The Home Secretary is perfectly aware of the gravity of the crimes
alleged against Pinochet but his impartial judgment in these matters is a most
important safeguard for the accused and the interests of justice generally.<
``It's simply not possible for the Home Secretary to regard Pinochet's
extradition as being nothing more than a symbol for the outrage that most people
will feel about what happened in Chile in the 1970s.<
  ``He has to remind himself at every stage that General Pinochet is at the
moment an unconvicted accused who must be treated fairly like every other
accused and extradition procedures and his own human rights must be protected.<
``The stronger the feelings people have against General Pinochet, the more
important it is that this function should be conducted with detachment and
compassion.''<
Mr Sumption said although Mr Straw had made it clear he would rather the
medical report on the general had been disclosed to the states requesting his
extradition, he would not have intended to disclose it to ``pressure groups''
such as Amnesty International.<
However, in the interests of holding a consultation exercise, the Home
Secretary had disclosed the names of the medical team, their findings that the
general was mentally unfit to stand trial, the criteria they used to assess him
and the instructions given to the medics.<
Mr Straw had taken an ``exceptional step'' in giving Amnesty International and
other parties the opportunity to make representations.<
The degree of disclosure enabled the group to know why the Secretary of State
was proceeding thus and to argue against it.<
The only option not open to them was to study the medical report.<
However, Mr Sumption said: ``It was not the purpose of the consultation
exercise to obtain the advice of Amnesty International and the human rights
organisations about the clinical condition of Senator Pinochet in the
circumstances where the steps to establish those facts had been taken in the
only appropriate way.''<
Mr Sumption pointed out that the first evidence Mr Straw had of Pinochet's
illness came from reports compiled by the general's own doctors.<
If Pinochet had refused to undergo further medical tests at the request of the
Home Office, Mr Straw would have had to take into account that evidence.<
However, more tests were arranged, on the express understanding that they were
confidential.<
Mr Straw was under no obligation to arrange tests for any other party to carry
out a medical examination.<
The examination and report he commissioned was sufficient for him to carry out
his public duties, the court was told.<
Nor was there any reason to suppose Pinochet would consent to be examined by
other parties and there would be no legal basis on which he could be compelled
to submit to any further tests.<
``Once accepted that other parties could not have commissioned or conducted a
medical examination, it's difficult to see what purpose would be served by their
having an opportunity to study the report,'' Mr Sumption said.<
The report was a matter of professional opinion of four highly eminent medical
experts.<
While it was possible there was a factual error in the report, this was
unlikely given the eminence of the team and the fact that the report had been
reviewed by the Chief Medical Officer.<
It was not a strong enough possibility to outweigh the duty of confidentiality
owed to Pinochet.<
Mr Sumption also argued the principle that when a public authority was in
possession of sensitive information about an individual, that information should
only be disclosed to the extent that it enabled that authority to perform their
legal duties.<
``Senator Pinochet has consented to the degree of disclosure which is required
to enable those with public duties to perform to perform them,'' he said.<
