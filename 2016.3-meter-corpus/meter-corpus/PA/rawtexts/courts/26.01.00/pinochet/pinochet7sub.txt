           16:54 26/01/00: Page 7 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Sumption said the Home Secretary had ordered his own independent, impartial
report on Pinochet's health which the human rights organisations simply did not
like because it had come to a conclusion which was favourable to the general.<
``In a difficult situation the Secretary of State has got the balance exactly
right and there is absolutely no basis in these applications for supposing his
conclusion was perverse or in any other way unlawful.''<
The QC questioned the legal right of either Belgium or the human rights groups
to mount today's challenges.<
He said there was no prospect of Pinochet being sent to Belgium to stand
trial, and the law gave organisations like Amnesty no right to intervene in
criminal matters.<
Contrary to what had been said in court earlier, the Home Secretary had not
invited representations from Belgium on the Pinochet case.<
Mr Sumption said the letter of request from Belgium was a ``diatribe''
against the decision of the Home Secretary.<
He said: ``I must be careful what I say in this court about a friendly foreign
Government.<
``But there are aspects of this letter of request that are surprising.<
``This is either a collateral process to get confidential material for use in
the UK, or the Belgians have not thought it through.''<
He said there was no power for the Government to detain a man in England
while a judge in a foreign country where ``he's most unlikely to end up'' tried
to gather enough information on him.<
He added that Belgium also had no right to object to Britain stopping an
extradition request on grounds that the defendant was unfit to stand trial.<
The hearing will continue tomorrow. Judgment is expected to be reserved until
the end of the week or Monday.<
