BUSINESSWOMAN `PUNCHED AIR STEWARD TRYING TO STOP ROW'<
By Martha Linden, PA News<
A row over a reclining seat during a transatlantic night flight ended with an
air steward being punched by a businesswoman, a court heard today.<
James Morris, a cabin crew member with Virgin Atlantic Airways, said Heather
Tagg, 33, had ``swung her fist at him'' after he intervened in an argument she
was having with another passenger over the use of a reclining seat, during a
flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Gatwick in London.<
``There was some choice language and both parties were irate,'' Mr Morris told
Croydon Crown Court.<
``As I approached they were arguing over the gentlemen reclining his seat.''<
He said he had attempted to prevent Tagg pushing past him to reach the other
passenger by placing himself in between them. It was at that point that Tagg had
``swung a fist'' at him, hitting him on his shoulder.<
Mr Morris was speaking on the second day of a trial in which Tagg, of Red Barn
Mews, High Street, Battle, in East Sussex, is accused of assaulting him and
fellow cabin crew member Elizabeth Voyce, during the flight on February 11 last
year. She is also charged with being drunk on board the aircraft.<
Tagg has denied all three charges.<
Mr Morris said he had managed to wrestle Tagg to the floor on a second attempt
by using a wrist lock.<
Asked what his impression was of Tagg's behaviour he said: ``She had been
drinking.''<
He added: ``We could smell it on her breath, we could see bottles of vodka,
miniature bottles that had been bought from the duty-free and consumed on board.
They were directly at her seat.''<
Asked how he could know whether she had been drinking he said: ``You just know
... the way they talk, the aggression.''<
Mr Morris said Tagg had been taken to sit in a jump seat after the scuffle. <
He said police were called on board the plane when it landed in Gatwick.<
Under cross-examination by James Turner QC, defending, he admitted that he did
not know whether Tagg had in fact drunk the miniature bottles of vodka.<
She had been seated in a row alongside some men, he said. They had been
swapping seats, he told the court, and he had not seen who had drunk the
bottles. He told the court that there were at least five bottles underneath the
D and E seats of the row.<
Tagg had calmed down immediately after she had been wrestled to the floor, he
said, and had spoken to him in a ``civilised'' manner while she had been
confined to sitting in the jump seat.<
The scuffle took place at around 4.00am in the economy class area of the
aircraft, the court was told. <
