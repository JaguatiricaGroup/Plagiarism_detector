`AIR STEWARD PUT ME IN PAINFUL ARM-LOCK DURING FLIGHT ROW'<
By Martha Linden, PA News<
A businesswoman was grabbed in a painful arm-lock by an air steward after she
became involved in a row with a passenger, a court was told today.<
Heather Tagg, 33, said Virgin Atlantic Airways cabin crew member James Morris
had approached her from behind and attempted to force her to the floor after a
row broke out between her and a man in front during an overnight flight from
Newark, New Jersey, to Gatwick.<
She told Croydon Crown Court, south London, that she had been standing out of
her seat in the aisle area of the economy class of the aircraft when she was
grabbed from behind by Mr Morris.<
``My arm was in a straight arm-lock in the back. He was trying to lift me in
the air with my arm straight which would be forcing me over. It was really
hurting me I had to get him off me,'' she told the court.<
Tagg was speaking on the second day of a trial in which she pleads not guilty
to a charge of being drunk on board the flight, on February 11 last year.<
She also denies assaulting cabin crew Elizabeth Voyce and Mr Morris. <
Mrs Tagg said the row broke out after the man had turned around to tell her
and three men playing cards in her row to be quiet.<
She was incensed by the man's request as he had broken flight etiquette by
placing his chair in full reclining position immediately at the outset of the
flight.<
This had inconvenienced her, she said, and Virgin cabin crew staff had been
forced to tell him twice to put his chair upright before the plane took off, she
told the court.<
It was only early evening American time when they set out.<
She said she had intervened to speak to the man after he became involved in an
argument with her neighbour on the far end in her row in the centre aisle.<
``I spoke to the man in front of me. I said `I do not know how you can keep
going on about us being rude when the whole time during this flight you have had
your chair fully reclined'.''<
She added: ``He turned round and said to me `don't speak to me, you are drunk,
your breath smells of beer.'<
``He was trying to provoke me, I was not drunk at all'', Mrs Tagg said.<
She told the court she felt ``insulted'' by the man.<
``He had insulted me, so I said he cannot speak to me like that and as I said
that I went to get up out of my seat, but because he had his chair fully
reclined and as I had my tray down I could not stand so I stood into the
aisle.''<
The pair had begun shouting at each other, Mrs Tagg told the court and the
next thing she knew she had been grabbed from behind by Mr Morris.<
Under questioning from James Turner QC, defending, Mrs Tagg said she had drunk
three cans of lager and a whisky and coke on the flight.<
She had consumed a half pint of lager in the departure lounge in Newark just
before boarding.<
She was ``definitely not drunk at any stage'' during the flight and had not
assaulted any of the cabin crew, she told the court.<
She also denied buying any duty free alcohol or consuming any other drinks on
the flight.<
Mrs Tagg gave her address to the court as West 73rd Street, New York, but she
was also listed as living in Red Barn Mews, High Street, Battle, East Sussex.<
