             17:58 26/01/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Rage Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
After questioning by prosecution barrister Isobel Ascherson, Tagg said the group
she was with on the plane ``might have been a bit noisy''.<
She also said she had ``overreacted'' to the man in front after he turned
round and asked her group to be less noisy.<
She did not know the three men who were her neighbours, but had started
talking to them during the flight.<
All she knew was that one was called Jed and the other was called Charlie and
they came from the London area, she told the court.<
She had later scoured a London phone directory in an attempt to trace them
after she had been charged. The attempts were not successful.<
Tagg told the court she moved to the US in August 1998 and had since been a
frequent visitor to the UK.<
The proceedings were momentarily halted when she broke down in tears telling
the court that her sister was involved in a car accident two weeks before she
moved to the US in which she had broken her back.<
Her frequent returns to the UK were partly in order to visit her, she said.<
She had run a millinery business up until her move to New York, but had since
put her equipment into storage.<
Roger Tagg, Tagg's husband, of West 73rd Street, New York, told the court his
wife was a ``very, very nice sweet person''.<
He said they had been living in the US since August 1998. He was English-born
and a chartered accountant.<
He was currently vice president of a division of Time Warner, the media
entertainment company in the US.<
His wife had never been violent and the allegations against her were ``totally
inconsistent and completely out of character''.<
Mr Tagg said: ``She is very personable and very friendly. She makes friends
very very easily and is very sociable. She is not a confrontational character.<
``She is a very, very nice and sweet person and she makes friends very, very
easily.''<
Mr Tagg said the couple had been married since May 1992.<
Mrs Hillary Farley, from High Street, Ticehurst, East Sussex, a friend of Tagg
from their school days, said they had on occasions gone drinking but her friend
was not an alcoholic.<
Tagg's character was ``gregarious'', she said. ``She enjoys mixing with people
and she can mix easily with different groups.''<
Earlier today the court heard evidence from Mr Morris, who said Mrs Tagg had
``swung her fist'' at him, hitting him on his shoulder after he had intervened
in the row.<
Miss Voyce told the court yesterday in evidence that she was pushed backwards
over three seats by Tagg after Mr Morris had been punched.<
Miss Voyce said she fell over two passengers when she was pushed, bruising her
arm, back and legs as a result. <
The trial was adjourned until tomorrow when the jury is expected to retire
before lunchtime.<
