`WAR CRIMES JUDGE DID NOT ERR IN LAW' APPEAL COURT TOLD<
By Cathy Gordon, PA News<
A judge who presided at the trial of retired British Rail ticket collector
Anthony Sawoniuk- who was given two life sentences after becoming the first man
to be convicted in the UK of Nazi war crimes _ did not ``err in law'', the Court
of Appeal heard today.<
Sawoniuk, 78, who says his Old Bailey trial was an ``abuse of the process of
the court'', is urging three judges in London to quash his conviction as
``unsafe''.<
His counsel, William Clegg QC, has told the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham,
sitting with Mr Justice Tucker and Mrs Justice Hallett, that a fair trial was
impossible after the lapse of 57 years between the alleged offence and trial.<
Mr Clegg has submitted that the trial judge, Mr Justice Potts, erred in law in
failing to stay the two murder counts on the ground ``that the continued
prosecution of the appellant amounted to an abuse of the process of the
court''.<
But, Sir John Nutting QC, contesting the appeal on behalf of the Crown,
rejected the claims that the judge had erred in law and said he had approached
both murder counts ``in accordance with the correct legal principles''.<
He said: ``It is the trial process itself which is designed to regulate and
evaluate the weight of the evidence, its strengths and weaknesses.''<
On the issue of the lapse of time, he said: ``It is clear that the trial judge
was well aware and kept in the forefront of his directions to the jury the
potential problems caused by the passage of time.''<
He added: ``There are no fewer than 10 separate references, warnings,
directions, to the jury in respect of the passage of time.''<
At the end of Britain's first full war crimes trial last April, Sawoniuk, was
found guilty of both murder charges he faced.<
The jury, reduced to 11 through illness, found him guilty unanimously on the
first charge and by an 10-1 majority on the second.<
Frail and partially deaf Sawoniuk, from south east London, had denied
murdering Jews in his hometown of Domachevo, Belarus, 57 years ago while serving
in a local police force controlled by the Germans.<
His eight grounds of appeal are chiefly concerned with submissions that the
trial judge ``erred in law'' on a number of issues.<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow. The judges are expected to reserve
their decision.<
