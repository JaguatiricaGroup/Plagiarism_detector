TRIMBLE WITNESS IN `DOCUMENTARY HOAX' LIBEL CASE<
By Mike Taylor, PA News<
Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble is to be called to give
evidence in court following accusations that he was part of a high-powered
loyalist conspiracy to murder Catholics.<
The Nobel Peace Prize winner is a witness for The Sunday Times in its defence
to a High Court libel action brought in London by the man who accused him, TV
journalist Sean McPhilemy.<
Mr McPhilemy, who says his career was wrecked by the newspaper's allegation
that his Channel 4 documentary on Ulster death squads was a ``hoax'', has
written a book _ published officially only in the USA _ in which he concludes
that ten years ago Mr Trimble was ``knowingly associating with and assisting
those responsible for the murder of his own constituents''.<
Andrew Caldecott QC, for the newspaper, told Mr Justice Eady and the libel
jury today: ``Mr Trimble has put in some work, you may think, for peace and you
will be hearing from him in due course.''<
Mr Trimble, he said, was not mentioned in the documentary at the centre of the
case, but since its broadcast in 1991 Mr McPhilemy had written a book, The
Committee: Political Assassination in Northern Ireland.<
In that book _ published in 1998 in America where there was strong Irish
Republican support _ he named 50 or 60 people who, he claimed, made up a central
committee of Protestant police officers, businessmen, politicians and lawyers
and who were guilty of multiple murder.<
``Did he contact them before accusing them of murder? No he did not. And he is
still prosecutor, judge and jury and he won't give the defence a look-in,'' said
Mr Caldecott.<
