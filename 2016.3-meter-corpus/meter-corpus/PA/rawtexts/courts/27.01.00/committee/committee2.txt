  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Caldecott, illustrating a defence case that Mr McPhilemy was guilty of
distortion, unbalanced reporting and presenting lies as the truth, read the jury
extracts from his book, published as the Northern Ireland peace process was
getting under way.<
He read: ``I conclude, therefore, that David Trimble MP was knowingly
associating with and assisting those responsible for the murder of his own
constituents, victims of the committee such as three innocent Catholic teenagers
- Denis Carville, Eileen Duffy, Katrina Rennie - and the 29-year-old customer
shot dead as he approached the mobile sweet shop in Craigavon, Brian Frizzell.<
``None of these victims were members of Trimble's `Ulster British nation' but
all four of them, like many other Catholics killed in his constituency, were
murdered by his friends on the committee within just one year of his entry to
the House of Commons in May 1990.<
``So, the Member of Parliament for Upper Bann, William David Trimble, is, in
my judgment, as culpable for the terrorist acts of the Committee as is the
leader of the political wing of the Provisional IRA for that organisation's
crimes.''<
Mr Caldecott asked: ``Did Mr McPhilemy stoop to make one telephone call to Mr
Trimble before publishing that about him? No he did not. He made no effort to
contact Mr Trimble at all.''<
He told the jury: ``I just leave it to you to judge the effect of that type of
material, published in America in March 1998. What evidence did he have for that
appalling charge when he published it? I suggest he had no evidence worthy of
the name.''<
The allegations in the book, he said, revealed Mr McPhilemy's approach to
evidence and other people's reputations.<
