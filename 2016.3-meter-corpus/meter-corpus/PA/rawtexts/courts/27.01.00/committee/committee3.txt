In another extract from the book, Mr McPhilemy wrote that it was possible that
all issues relevant to the Committee's murder conspiracy would surface in his
libel action.<
Mr Trimble, he wrote, would then be ``given the opportunity to respond to my
belief that, in recognition of his efforts to protect the murder conspirators,
it is appropriate to enhance his standing as a prominent member of the Orange
Order by awarding him the title of leader of the political wing of the Ulster
Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee''.<
Mr Caldecott said that was the challenge issued in America. But in this
country Mr McPhilemy had tried to prevent those he accused of murder from giving
evidence. He had tried to keep the issue of falsity out of the action. He made
many legal attempts to do so, but failed.<
``Journalists are fond of saying that, in war, truth is the first casualty,''
said Mr Caldecott. ``You may think that, in the search for peace and knowing who
are murderers and who are not, truth is the first requirement.''<
Mr McPhilemy, 52, is suing the Sunday Times over a May 1993 article headlined:
Film on Ulster death squads a hoax.<
His documentary, The Committee, was largely based on the testimony of a
loyalist insider, Jim Sands, who also spoke of an ``inner force'' and an ``inner
circle'' within the RUC whose members colluded with loyalist terrorists to
murder IRA suspects.<
The newspaper said the film-makers ``stand accused of producing little more
than a collage of unsubstantiated rumours and fabrications''.<
