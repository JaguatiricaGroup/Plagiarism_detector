Earlier, Mr Caldecott had told the jury that some of the statements made by Jim
Sands when he was interviewed on film by Mr McPhilemy's researcher, Ben
Hamilton, were inconsistent and nonsensical.<
What the programme makers did with that material in preparing their
documentary was ``nothing short of disgraceful - simply distortion'', he said.<
``It was a scissors and paste job - a sentence here, a sentence there, and put
them together.<
``You will have to ask yourselves what was the importance of what was left on
the cutting room floor.''<
Mr McPhilemy had ``talked to the viewers about dynamite but all he had was a
damp squib''.<
Giving evidence, Mr McPhilemy, of St Margaret's Road, Oxford, said that by
1991 his company, Box Productions, had become one of the best known independent
production companies in the country.<
``It operated in a highly competitive market place ... and we unquestionably
lived on our reputation as the makers of sound factual documentary programmes,''
he said.<
He had alerted researcher Ben Hamilton, who suggested making the programme at
the centre of the action, of the ``absolutely crucial importance of being
detached and impartial''.<
``From the word go it was seen as an extremely sensitive project as we were
proposing to investigate the involvement of the security forces in murder,''
said Mr McPhilemy.<
Channel 4, which commissioned the documentary, warned that the makers must
behave with ``absolute professionalism throughout'', he said. It was the most
closely supervised programme he had ever been involved with.<
During his researches in Belfast, Mr Hamilton rang to say that he had been
told by a source (Sands) that someone was going to be murdered soon by
loyalists.<
Mr McPhilemy said: ``My focus was `Who is this guy?', `Why is he telling you
these things?' and most important of all `Is it true?'.<
``I have to say I reacted with some disbelief to what I was hearing because
here was ostensibly a member of a murder conspiracy admitting it rather casually
to someone of not very long acquaintance and moreover someone working for
national television.''<
Asked if he thought that Sands was just repeating rumours, Mr McPhilemy said:
``Absolutely not. This was a man claiming to have first hand experience of
meetings that he attended where murders were either planned or reviewed.''<
He added: ``I thought it was of enormous public importance because, in a
deeply divided community like Northern Ireland, the police force is an
institution which everybody ought to be able to trust and to look for for
security.<
``And if it was true that it had been corrupted to such a degree as he was
claiming then it was our duty to bring that to public attention.''<
Mr McPhilemy said that when he met Sands he discovered that he was a
``fanatic'' who believed that the British government was colluding with the IRA
to sell Ulster to Dublin.<
Asked if he was concerned about Sands's motivation, Mr McPhilemy said: ``Very
much so. I thought it was illogical, bizarre, almost crazy.''<
But, he added, Sands's view was that, because Ulster loyalists were being
``betrayed'' by Britain, he and a small number of the committee believed that
their work was laudable and favoured going public as the more the loyalists knew
about it, the better.<
Mr McPhilemy denied suggestions that Sands recited from a script during his
interview or was ``coached'' from a check list of questions.<
Although he was sceptical about some of things Sands said, subsequent
inquiries did not reveal anything which led him to disbelieve the central
allegation.<
The hearing, set for up to two months, continues tomorrow. Mr Trimble is not
expected to be called until the defence case begins in full.<
