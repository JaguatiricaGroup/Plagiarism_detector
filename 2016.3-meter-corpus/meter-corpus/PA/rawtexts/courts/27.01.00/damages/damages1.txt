BRAIN DAMAGE BOY, 8, GETS #2.9M DAMAGES<
By Mark Wilkinson, PA News<
An eight-year-old boy who suffered severe brain damage after medical staff
failed to spot danger signs at his birth was today awarded more than #2.9
million in damages by a High Court judge.<
Luke Warren, of Skegness, Lincolnshire, suffers from cerebral palsy and will
never be able to take care of himself after staff at Sheffield's Northern
General Hospital failed to detect foetal distress when he was born in November
1991.<
The hospital conceded that if doctors had intervened earlier with a Caesarean
section it would have spared Luke his injuries.<
Deputy High Court Judge Robert Smith QC, sitting in Sheffield, set the damages
at #2,911,849 _ which a lawyer said was one of the highest-ever awards for such
a case.<
The money is to cover the cost of Luke's continuing care, including speech
therapy, physiotherapy, housing, special educational needs and equipment, as
well as the loss of earnings of his parents, June and Steven Warren, who have
been their son's full-time carers since he was born.<
After the hearing, Mrs Warren said: ``This has been a long, hard battle. We
can now get on with giving Luke the care he needs and deserves.''<
The failure by hospital staff to spot foetal distress meant Luke was born
dead.<
He was gradually revived and could breathe for himself within 20 minutes, but
by then had already suffered massive injuries.<
John Pickering, head of personal injury at Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, who
acted for Luke and his family, said: ``Luke is a happy young boy but he is so
disabled that he cannot sit independently and requires a walking frame or
electric wheelchair for mobility.<
``He can now nearly spoon feed himself, but he requires assistance dressing
and undressing, and his communication skills are minimal.<
``His family is dedicated to his care and both Luke's mother and father have
not been able to work since his birth because of the constant attention he
needs.<
``The award covers a large number of areas including the need for Luke to
receive full-time care for the rest of his life, the cost of aids, suitably
adapted accommodation and appropriate education. All are expensive requirements,
hence the size of the award.''<
The Warren family, which also includes three other children, Daniel, 18,
Richard, 16 and Marie, 14, lived in Sheffield until July 1998 before moving to
Skegness.<
Luke attends Eresby School in Spilsby, Lincolnshire, where staff said he was
one of the most popular members of his class.<
A spokesman for the Northern General Hospital NHS Trust said: ``We deeply
regret the train of events that led to the damage caused to Luke during his
difficult birth.<
``The trust has always accepted responsibility in this case. We recognise that
there were procedures that could have been improved and they now have. Human
error did occur and we very much regret it.<
``Although tightening up procedures may not provide Mr and Mrs Warren with any
real comfort, we nevertheless offer our deepest sympathy and apologise
unreservedly for the effects this tragic accident has had on the family.''<
