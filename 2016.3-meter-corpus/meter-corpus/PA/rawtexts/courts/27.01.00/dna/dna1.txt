DNA TEST NETS KILLER AFTER 14 YEARS<
By Adam Jankiewicz, PA News<
A father of four was sentenced to life imprisonment today after advances in
DNA techniques linked him to a murder he committed 14 years ago.<
Duncan Jackson, 37, of Runham Close, Luton, Bedfordshire, was convicted of
battering and strangling petite Avril Dunn in Luton on September 14, 1985.<
Today a jury at Reading Crown Court, having spent more than nine hours
deliberating, convicted him by a majority of 10 to two of murdering
Scottish-born Mrs Dunn when she was 26.<
Forensic scientists managed to extract a DNA fingerprint from the victim's
semen-stained clothing during the late 90s which had a one billion to one chance
of not belonging to the defendant, the jury was told.<
During the three-week trial Christopher Hotten QC, prosecuting, told the jury:
``In 1985 identification by DNA analysis was in its infancy. Technology
available to forensic scientists did not enable police to determine whose semen
was on her clothes.''<
The murder remained ``unsolved, but not forgotten'' with all the exhibits and
witness statements collected at the time of the murder preserved in the hope
that one day ``further investigations or scientific breakthroughs would enable
the killer to be identified'', Mr Hotten said.<
``By the 1990s technology for DNA testing had greatly advanced. The
semen-stained clothing was returned to the laboratory and this time the
scientists were able to extract samples of DNA.''<
Sentencing Jackson to life imprisonment Mr Justice Garland praised scientists
for bringing him to justice.<
He said: ``I would like to pay a tribute to the remarkable forensic research
that went into this case and the quite staggering DNA forecast.<
``It is the greatest possible tribute to forensic science in this case.''<
