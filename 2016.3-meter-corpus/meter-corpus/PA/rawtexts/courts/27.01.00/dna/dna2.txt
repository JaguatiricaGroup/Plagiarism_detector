The body of Avril Dunn, who was just 4ft 10in tall and weighed five and a half
stone, was discovered with many of her clothes missing in a small wood off
Spinney Road, Luton, on September 15, 1985 by a man out walking his dog.<
Jackson denied having murdered her and said he had left the Heron pub near
where both of them lived shortly after Mrs Dunn had begun her short walk home.<
He said he had returned straight home to his wife.<
In fact he had lured his victim to sheds in the nearby village of Sundon and
strangled her.<
Detective Inspector Keith Garwood of Bedfordshire police, who led the current
investigation, said today: ``I am clearly delighted by the result of this
matter. This has been a long and very difficult inquiry.<
``It has affected the lives of a very many people. I am particularly grateful
for the support of Avril Dunn's family who have supported the police service
throughout.''<
He added: ``We are very fortunate for the tremendous turnaround in forensic
science that led to the breakthrough in this case and opened the door for us to
reach Jackson.''<
On hearing of his daughter's murderer's conviction, Tommy Dunn said: ``After a
long and arduous time we are pleased that it has come to a satisfactory end,
both for our family and the police, who, over the past 14 years have never given
up in their resolve to bring this to a just and fitting end.<
``The loss of our daughter has been a tremendous blow to us and we have never
been able to be reconciled in our loss. She is with us always.<
``We would like to thank the police for the kindness and consideration shown
to our family, not only at our initial loss but over the 14 years, during which
period they've kept us informed of all developments.''<
