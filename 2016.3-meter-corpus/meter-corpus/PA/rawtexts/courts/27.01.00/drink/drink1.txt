DRINK-DRIVER WHO KILLED GIRL GETS SEVEN YEARS<
By Mike Brownhill, PA News<
A convicted drink-driver who went on a day-long drinking session then got into
his car and led police on a high speed chase before running down and killing a
schoolgirl was jailed today for seven-and-a-half years.<
Raymond Albert, 28, was already serving a two-year drink-driving ban when he
ran down 16-year-old A-level student Lydia Morgan, a court was told.<
Unemployed Albert had driven to a garage in his home town of Merthyr Tydfil,
south Wales, to buy cigarettes but police spotted him nearly hitting another car
as he drove home.<
Officers followed Albert's Rover 213 as he went through the town centre but
lost sight of him when he sped off at high speed after ramming two taxis, Mr
Richard Twomlow, prosecuting, told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court.<
But Albert lost control of the car, which he bought for #100, on a bend, then
smashed into a bus shelter before hitting Miss Morgan, who was walking on the
pavement to her grandmother's house.<
The car finally came to rest 60 yards down the road.<
Miss Morgan, who had gained four GCSE A grades and five B grades and was
studying maths, chemistry and biology A-levels in the hope of becoming a doctor,
died of massive head injuries.<
Albert was later breathalysed and found to have 118 micrograms of alcohol per
100 millilitres of breath _ the legal limit is 35 _ said Mr Twomlow.<
He was under a two-year ban after being convicted of driving while three times
above the limit _ he had 116 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath
_ in 1997.<
Police who arrived at the scene found Albert still trying to restart his car
in a bid to drive off, said Mr Twomlow.<
Albert had spent the day drinking in local pubs _ a barmaid in one said he was
``quite tight'' when he left to return home.<
``He realised he did not have any cigarettes and used his car to drive to a
garage. Two police officers noticed he was travelling at excess speed and
narrowly missing another car at a junction,'' Mr Twomlow said.<
``They followed him with their lights and sirens on but the defendant did not
respond. The Rover was drifting back and forth across the carriageway.<
``He drove around the town centre at slow speed with the police car behind.
The officers shouted for him to stop which he did.<
``As one of the officers got out of his car Albert looked directly at him,
took a drag on his cigarette and drove off at speed.''<
As police followed Albert at high speed through the town centre, he rammed two
cars out of his way and forced a group of women to run out of his path.<
He then lost control of the car on a bend and hit a parked taxi and a bus
shelter before ploughing into Miss Morgan.<
Mr Twomlow said: ``Lydia was walking towards the bus shelter when she was
struck by the car. When the police arrived Albert was still frantically trying
to start the car and drive off.<
``Lydia had severe head injuries and never regained consciousness.''<
Albert told police in officers that he felt ``dreadful'' about the
schoolgirl's death and wanted to apologise.<
Mr Charles Cook, defending, said: ``What happened on this tragic night cannot
be undone. He is not an habitual offender _ when he is his normal self he is
well thought of.''<
He said Albert underwent a change in his personality following the death of
his father _ the accident happened in the anniversary of the death.<
Albert, of Georgetown, Merthyr Tydfil, admitted causing death by dangerous
driving, driving while disqualified, driving with excess alcohol and driving
without insurance.<
Jailing him for seven-and-a-half years, Judge John Curran said: ``Offences of
causing death by dangerous driving are always serious, but this is a bad case.<
``No comment or sentence can ever put right the permanent feelings of loss,
grieving and devastation which are suffered by the victims' families.''<
