                 17:15 27/01/00: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Minibus
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stipendiary magistrate David Meredith disqualified Jagger from driving for two
years, fined him #2,500 and ordered him to pay #500 towards court costs.<
Mr Meredith found Jagger was driving at 56mph at the moment of impact,
exceeding the limit for a HGV on that section of road.<
He believed Jagger had not seen the minibus just before the collision, which
happened at 8pm.<
He said: ``Did you see the minibus? At the very least you did not see it until
very late and I do not think you saw it at all.''<
He concluded: ``Either you fell asleep at the wheel or there was a total lapse
in concentration and awareness.''<
Rosalind Goodall, whose son Jeremy, 30, died in the accident, said after the
case: ``We hoped for a guilty verdict. As long as someone has been held
responsible for the five deaths then we are happy.<
``I am pleased with the penalty. There is not a lot more that could have been
imposed on him at magistrates court.''<
``Some sort of justice has certainly been done, but nothing will bring them
back.''<
Jagger refused to comment after the case.<
