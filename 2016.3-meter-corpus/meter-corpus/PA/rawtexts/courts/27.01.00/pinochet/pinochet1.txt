HUMAN RIGHTS LEGAL CHALLENGE TO PINOCHET'S RETURN HOME<
By PA News Reporters<
A High Court challenge was continuing today over Home Secretary Jack Straw's
decision to allow former dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health
grounds.<
Lawyers acting for Belgium and six human rights groups are seeking leave for a
judicial review of Mr Straw's decision that extradition proceedings against the
84-year-old should be dropped because of his ill-health.<
At the hearing before Mr Justice Maurice Kay yesterday, they argued that it
would be against the public interest not to allow his opponents to know the
medical reasons and have an opportunity to mount legal challenges to block the
general's departure.<
They accused Mr Straw of acting in breach of natural justice by refusing them
access to the confidential reports of medical experts who examined the general
earlier this month and found that he was ``simply not capable of participating
in a trial''.<
But Jonathan Sumption QC, appearing for the Home Secretary, strongly
criticised the Belgian intervention and said Amnesty and other human rights
campaigners had no legal right to be heard in extradition matters.<
The QC described how Mr Straw had ordered his own independent, impartial
report on Pinochet's health. He said it was unwelcome because it had come to a
conclusion which was favourable to the general's return home.<
Belgium is claiming that, as one of the states wanting Pinochet's extradition,
it should have been allowed to see the medical evidence behind Mr Straw's
decision that he was ``minded'' to allow the general to go home.<
Belgium is among the four countries, led by Spain, trying to extradite
Pinochet on the basis of claims from Chilean refugees that he was behind the
jailing and killing of their relatives.<
Pinochet will remain under house arrest on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey
until the matter is resolved.<
A plane sent from Chile to bring him home is still in Bermuda awaiting a
decision by the Home Secretary.<
