PINOCHET CHALLENGE _ JUDGE TO GIVE DECISION NEXT WEEK<
By John Aston, PA News<
Groups which oppose the Home Secretary's indication that he plans to allow
former dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health grounds will learn
next week whether they can go ahead with a last-ditch legal challenge.<
Following a hearing lasting one-and-a-half days for permission to bring the
High Court action, a judge said today he would give his ruling on Monday
morning.<
Belgium and six human rights groups applied to Mr Justice Maurice Kay for
leave to seek judicial review, arguing that it would be against the public
interest if they were denied access to the medical reasons why Home Secretary
Jack Straw has said he is ``minded'' to drop extradition proceedings against the
84-year-old general on compassionate grounds.<
Belgium is among the four countries, led by Spain, trying to extradite General
Pinochet on torture charges.<
Belgian and human rights lawyers argued that Mr Straw's decision was fatally
flawed because he had failed to act ``lawfully, fairly and rationally''.<
The Home Secretary's refusal to allow them to see the independent medical
report which had led to the decision that General Pinochet was unfit to be
extradited to stand trial meant they could not make ``meaningful''
representations, or challenge the general's return home in the courts.<
Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, appearing for Belgium, rejected strong criticism
from Mr Straw's lawyers of that country's intervention in the Pinochet case.<
Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, for the Home Secretary, had described Belgium's
letter of request for disclosure of the confidential medical reasons as a
``diatribe'' against the minister's decision.<
But Ms Baxendale said that the request was legally justified as Belgium was,
along with Spain, Switzerland and France, actively seeking Pinochet's
extradition.<
There had been a failure ``to provide a proper opportunity for Belgium to make
comments on a proposed decision which has very important consequences for
Belgium's position'', she said.<
Mr Richard Drabble QC called for disclosure of the medical reports on behalf
of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Medical Foundation for the
Care of Victims of Torture, the Redress Trust, the Association of Relatives of
the Disappeared, and Justicia.<
A final decision by Mr Straw to drop extradition proceedings against General
Pinochet could end the last hope of redress for victims who suffered under his
regime, and their families, he said.<
The case raised issues of fundamental importance involving the rights of the
victims now living in the countries which were seeking extradition.<
``It is no answer to say that doesn't matter on the facts of this case because
the Secretary of State has appointed a highly respectable panel, and there is no
need for any sort of independent scrutiny of the decision,'' Mr Drabble said.<
Mr Straw has undertaken not make a final decision on whether to allow General
Pinochet to return to Chile while the current challenge is heard by the courts.<
The Home Secretary has repeatedly insisted that he cannot disclose details of
the medical report because they are covered by the rules of medical
confidentiality.<
Home Office sources said the Home Secretary had appealed to lawyers acting for
the General to waive that right to privacy, but that his appeal had been
rejected.<
General Pinochet will remain under house arrest on the Wentworth Estate in
Surrey until the matter is resolved.<
