PINOCHET CHALLENGE `LEGALLY JUSTIFIED' - QC<
By John Aston, PA News<
A lawyer acting for Belgium hit back today following strong criticism in the
High Court of the country's intervention in the Pinochet extradition case.<
Lawyers for Home Secretary Jack Straw said he had never invited
representations from Belgium over his decision that he was ``minded'' to allow
former dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health grounds.<
Jonathan Sumption QC, appearing for the Home Secretary, described yesterday
the Belgian letter of request for disclosure of the confidential medical
reasons, with a view to a possible legal challenge, as a ``diatribe'' against
the decision of the Home Secretary.<
But today Presiley Baxendale QC said that the request was legally justified as
Belgium was one of the states seeking Pinochet's extradition.<
She said the Belgian complaint was that there had been a failure ``to provide
a proper opportunity for Belgium to make comments on a proposed decision which
has very important consequences for Belgium's position.''<
The ``rules of procedural fairness'' had been breached.<
Belgium and six human rights groups are applying to Mr Justice Maurice Kay for
permission to seek judicial review, arguing it would be against the public
interest if they were denied access to the medical reasons behind Mr Straw's
decision and given the opportunity to mount legal challenges to block the
84-year-old general's departure back to Chile.<
Belgium is among the four countries, led by Spain, trying to extradite
Pinochet on torture charges.<
Richard Drabble QC is calling for disclosure of the medical reports on behalf
of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Medical Foundation for the
Care of Victims of Torture, the Redress Trust, the Association of Relatives of
the Disappeared and Justicia.<
