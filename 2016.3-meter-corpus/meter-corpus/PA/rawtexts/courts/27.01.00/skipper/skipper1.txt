DRUNKEN SKIPPER FACES JAIL OVER SHIP'S GROUNDING<
By Paul Watson, PA News<
The drunken skipper of a cargo ship which ran aground after he dozed off was
today facing a prison sentence after admitting breaching the Merchant Shipping
Act.<
Polish Chief Officer Jerzy Pawluk was in charge of the 900-tonne MV Roustel
when he left the bridge to go back to his bunk after swigging whisky.<
He had put the ship on auto-pilot but had turned off a watch-keeping alarm
which should have sounded every ten minutes to ensure someone was there.<
The vessel steamed through the night without anyone in control before finally
running aground on Red Head, near the Scottish coastal town of Montrose, in
December.<
The six-strong crew of the 200ft ship were still in their bunks when it ran
aground.<
Pawluk, 42, later pleaded guilty to conduct endangering ships, structures or
individuals under Section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act.<
Magistrates in South Tyneside remanded him in custody and committed him for
sentence at Newcastle Crown Court, saying only a custodial sentence would be
appropriate.<
The charge, brought by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, can carry a
two-year prison sentence or an unlimited fine, or both.<
During the MCA investigation Mr Pawluk admitted that he had been solely
responsible for the navigation of the ship and that, having taken over the
watch, he drank whisky and became drunk.<
He also admitted that he turned off the watch-keeping alarm; that in failing
to do his duty he had endangered the lives of those on his ship; and that if the
vessel had collided with another ship the loss of the ship and the death of
those aboard could have been a consequence.<
MCA prosecutor Captain Mark Capon, who presented the case before magistrates,
said: ``This incident was an appalling failure of a seaman's duty.''<
The MCA is an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions and is responsible for the enforcement of merchant shipping
legislation.<
