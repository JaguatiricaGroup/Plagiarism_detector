DRUNKEN SAILOR JAILED OVER SHIP GROUNDING<
By Paul Watson, PA News<
A drunken seaman whose 200ft cargo ship ran aground causing #100,000 worth of
damage after he fell asleep on watch duty was today jailed for six months by a
judge who told him it was an ``act of God'' that none of the crew had perished.<
Polish Chief Officer Jerzy Pawluk, a former Polish Navy Lieutenant, was in
charge of the 900-tonne MV Roustel when he left the bridge to stagger back to
his bunk after swigging whisky.<
The ship was had been heading from Scotland to Teesside when the incident
happened last December.<
He had put the ship on auto-pilot but had turned off a watch-keeping alarm
which should have sounded every ten minutes to ensure someone was there.<
The vessel steamed through the night without anyone in control before finally
running aground on Red Head, near the Scottish coastal town of Montrose, in
December.<
It was not carrying any cargo but had 16,000 litres of diesel on board.<
The six-strong crew of the vessel were still in their bunks when it ran
aground in heavy seas.<
Pawluk, 42, was today sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court after earlier
pleading guilty to conduct endangering ships, structures or individuals under
Section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act.<
The court heard the watch duty was split between the ship's captain and the
chief officer who both did two six-hour watches every day.<
Pawluk was arrested in Tyneside when the vessel was taken into dry dock to be
repaired.<
The charges were brought by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency which is an
executive arm of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions
and is responsible for the enforcement of merchant shipping legislation.<
Judge Denis Orde told Pawluk: ``You chose to disable yourself from carrying
out your duty when you drank yourself into oblivion that night.<
``At the very least you demonstrated a wanton and total disregard for the
safety of your fellow crew members and the safety of other traffic on the high
seas.<
``It became, in effect, a ghost ship with 890 tonnes of metal, carrying 16,000
litres of diesel travelling at full speed through the night without any human
direction at all.<
``Had it struck rocks to the north or south of where it ran aground, or
collided with another vessel there could have been wholesale slaughter.<
``It was an act of God that you ran aground on shingle.<
``It was a grave dereliction of duty because you have enough experience of
navigation from your 20 years at sea.''<
Paul Caulfield, dfending, told the court: ``The personal effects of this case
are yet to be felt but they will be devastating.<
``This constitutes for this man a personal tragedy. He has lost his career and
lives in a mountainous region of Poland where he is the sole breadwinner for his
ailing elderly mother and his fiancee.<
``Upon his return he will be pressed by the state into a menial job with
extremely poor remuneration.''<
Judge Orde sentenced Pawluk to 12 months in prison but ordered that only the
first six be spent in custody.<
