SUBURBAN LIVES SHATTERED BY SOAP-STYLE MURDER PLOT<
By Rachael Crofts, PA News<
The sinister conspiracy of life-long friends Sandra Jones and Julie Harvey to
hire contract killer Matthew Lee could have come straight from the pages of a
soap opera script.<
Less than a year after families across Britain were gripped by an EastEnders'
storyline in which Cindy Beale plotted to murder husband Ian, in the small
Staffordshire market town of Uttoxeter the drama was acted out for real.<
Jones, 38, decided she wanted to be rid of husband Clifford, 35, and together
with schoolfriend Harvey, 34, the pair hatched a murderous plot.<
After a couple of failed attempts to procure guns and assassins, they finally
persuaded Lee, 53, a convicted murderer who had already served a life sentence,
to kill Clifford Jones.<
But, as life mirrored soap, the hitman bungled the job and the intended victim
survived to give police vital evidence about the attack.<
Just what prompted Jones to cross the line from dissatisfied wife to cold and
calculating conspirator bent on murder, remains a mystery.<
By all accounts the Joneses led an ordinary life bordering on the mundane. A
semi-detached home in suburbia, two young children, manual jobs.<
But then a chance meeting during a shopping trip in late 1998 reunited Jones
with her former schoolfriend Harvey.<
The pair renewed their friendship, with Jones allegedly confiding in Harvey
that she was the victim of a violent relationship.<
The marriage had undergone ``turbulent'' periods according to both parties,
but detectives who probed the background to the case found nothing to support
Jones' claims that she was a battered wife, an allegation which has been
consistently denied by Clifford Jones.<
Those looking for a motive behind the case found the desire for financial gain
more plausible. Clifford Jones was well insured, with a personal policy worth
#5,000, a second one clearing the mortgage, and a further #95,000 pay-out from
his employers, JCB at nearby Rocester, if he died whilst employed by the
company.<
Whatever the motivation, detectives were convinced Harvey's influence was
crucial in persuading Jones to carry out the plan.<
Det Chief Insp Peter Hall explained: ``We believe that Julie Harvey encouraged
Sandra because it is believed that Harvey had been a victim of violence
herself.''<
Jones arranged loans of more than #18,000 to pay for the contract killing and
made approaches to two possible hitmen before she and Harvey targeted Matthew
Lee, an odd job man at the White Horse Pub in Uttoxeter where Harvey worked as a
cleaner, and who was known to have served a prison term for murder.<
Lee came to the UK in 1961 from Jamaica, settled initially in London and found
work as a painter and decorator.<
But in 1980 the father-of-six became involved in a dispute with a customer,
Balli Chotiomall Sadhuani, 42, over bad workmanship carried out by a
subcontractor.<
Sadhuani refused to settle the #125 bill and Lee went to his North London
premises, bound and gagged a clerk there and locked him in a cupboard.<
He then waited for Sadhuani, attacked him with a hammer, bound and gagged him
and set fire to the premises. The clerk managed to free himself and escaped
through a window, but Sadhuani choked on the gag and died.<
Lee was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in July 1981 and sentenced to a
term of life imprisonment, serving 16 years before being released from Sudbury
Open Prison in Derbyshire in 1997.<
He was befriended by a local minister who offered him a temporary home in the
area and Lee found work at The Talbot pub in Uttoxeter, which was then run by
landlord Colin Veitch, who later moved to the White Horse.<
Mr Veitch was to provide crucial evidence linking the two women to Lee. The
licensee told police of scores of hushed meetings in the bar of his pub between
the three conspirators in the days before the attempted murder.<
On the morning of February 18 1999 Lee let himself into the Jones's home in
Beckdale, Uttoexter, with a key cut for him by Sandra, and attacked Clifford
Jones in bed with a crow bar.<
The attempt failed. Clifford Jones put up a good fight and eventually disarmed
his attacker, who ran from the house.<
But the shock of the attack was to prove secondary to his utter disbelief and
devastation when just days later officers arrived to arrest his wife for
plotting murder.<
Arresting officer Det Sgt John Bloor explained: ``We soon realised this was
not a robbery _ it was immediately clear all was not as it seemed. Within days
our inquires led to us Sandra Jones and Julie Harvey.<
``When we went to arrest Jones, I initially asked to speak to Clifford in
private first, to explain what was happening. But he refused and we had to make
the arrest in front of him without warning.<
``To say he was speechless is an understatement. He was utterly shattered. It
has been a terrible thing for him to try to come to terms with. It may be that
he never will.''<
