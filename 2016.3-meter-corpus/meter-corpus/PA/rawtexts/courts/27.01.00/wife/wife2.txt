The court heard that Jones stood to gain financially from her husband's death
and that she and mother-of-three Harvey had even discussed using the proceeds of
the windfall to pay for a holiday.<
The judge told the women, who both pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to
murder, that their friendship had turned a ``daft notion'' in the back of Jones'
mind into a reality.<
He added: ``Both of you lived for a period in a state devoid of reality. I
also think that it was unfortunate that you happened to bump into somebody like
Matthew Lee, only too prepared to do your bidding.''<
The judge told Lee, who was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in 1981,
that his attack on Mr Jones had been savage and it was ``good fortune'' that he
survived.<
``You are a lethally dangerous man. In my judgment, you still remain a
lethally dangerous man. I have no doubt at all that the only motivation for you
committing this offence was to make money for yourself,'' he said.<
Lee, who was found guilty by a jury, was jailed for life under the so-called
``two strikes and out'' law governing serious offences.<
He will not be considered for release for at least five years.<
Bernard Thorogood, prosecuting, said the Joneses had been teenage sweethearts
who married in 1986 and moved into the semi-detached home where the attack took
place in 1989.<
The court heard Mrs Jones stood to gain a #96,000 pay-out from her husband's
employer in the event of his death.<
The prosecutor said: ``She could not repay the #6,000 loan she took out to pay
the proposed killer unless she had been paid out for his death.''<
