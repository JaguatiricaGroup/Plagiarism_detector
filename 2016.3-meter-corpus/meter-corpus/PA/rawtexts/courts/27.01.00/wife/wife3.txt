The bank loan to pay the killer was taken out in December 1998 after Harvey
witnessed a form bearing Mr Jones's purported signature.<
Sandra Jones recruited Lee after learning from a pub landlord that he was a
convicted murderer and the burly hitman agreed to carry out the killing for
#1,500 upfront and a further #4,000 at about the time of the death.<
JCB worker Mr Jones told the court he awoke to see a man armed with a crowbar
at the end of his bed.<
He suffered severe facial injuries requiring several stitches but managed to
fight off his assailant in the attack on February 18 last year.<
Lee had been on a reconnaissance mission to the Jones's home, plotting to
disguise the killing as an apparent break-in.<
Mr Thorogood said Mr Jones was fortunate to survive and may have owed his life
to two pillows which cushioned the force of the blows.<
William Wood QC, defending Jones, said she was a ``cowering mouse'' who had
been subjected to domestic violence, including being hit over the head with a
bag containing two bowling balls.<
Mr Wood said the plot had been a ``madcap `folie a deux''' in which Harvey's
history of unhappy marriages fuelled Jones's bitterness towards her husband.<
Robert Juckes QC, defending Harvey, said the plan had been ill thought-out
with no regard to the consequences of being caught.<
