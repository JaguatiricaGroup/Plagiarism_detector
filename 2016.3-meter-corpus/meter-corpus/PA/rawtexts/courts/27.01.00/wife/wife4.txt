Speaking after the case, Mr Jones said he was ``sad'' he would have to break the
news of his wife's imprisonment to their 13-year-old daughter and eight-year-old
son.<
The intended target of the plot, who wrote to the judge urging leniency for
Mrs Jones, said: ``I get no satisfaction from this. Hopefully the letter has
helped her. I find it hard to be bitter with the children involved.<
``It was not me who pressed charges. I have no real feeling for Matthew Lee.
He had to go down as he is a danger to the public but as far as Sandra goes, it
should never have got this far.<
``The law has to do what it has to do but time will tell what effect it will
have on the children.<
``They have already seen their mum taken away once when she was on remand and
now I have got to go home and explain all this again.<
``I don't feel happy. I think it's very sad. It's a situation that should
never have occurred,'' he said.<
He denied allegations made by Mrs Jones's barrister that he had thrown a knife
at his wife and hit her with bowling balls.<
