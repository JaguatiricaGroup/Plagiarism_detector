CHILE CLAIMS PINOCHET `COULD DIE IN BRITAIN'<
By John Deane and Martha Linden, PA News<
Extradition proceedings were beginning today against former Chilean dictator
General Augusto Pinochet amid claims he is at risk of dying in Britain.<
Chile's foreign minister Juan Gabriel Valdes said the 83-year-old general
would never give up his fight against Spain's attempt to extradite him from
Britain _ and warned he could die during the protracted battle.<
``It is clear that his lawyers will present all the appeals that are necessary
so that Pinochet does not go to Spain,'' Mr Valdes said in an interview
published in the Spanish newspaper El Pais.<
He added that he feared a ``fatal outcome'' as the general's health was
unlikely to withstand a legal battle that could take more than two years.<
Mr Valdes' remarks came after The Sunday Times reported that Pinochet had
suffered a stroke which has left him bedridden for more than two weeks.<
Diplomatic sources were said to have told the newspaper that the general's
team of doctors believed he could suffer another stroke which might put his life
in danger.<
He is known to wear a heart pacemaker and has suffered from diabetes and a
range of other ailments.<
The spotlight of the world's media is due to be turned on Bow Street
Magistrates' Court in London today when the extradition case gets under way.<
In a case initiated by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who has accused the
general of a string of human rights crimes during his 1973-90 rule, Pinochet
will face around 36 charges, mainly allegations of torture.<
The detailed charges will be rehearsed during today's opening session of the
formal extradition hearing.<
It will be taken up with complex arguments on extradition law, notably the
European Convention on Extradition, to which Britain and Spain are parties.<
The Home Office rejected claims by former Chancellor Lord Lamont that the
Government could be considering a deal to send the general back to Chile on
humanitarian grounds if his lawyers did not press ahead with their appeal
against his extradition to Spain.<
Lord Lamont said there had been reports in the foreign press that ministers
were considering the deal, although the Government has previously insisted the
extradition was purely a legal process.<
But a Home Office spokesman said: ``There is no deal. The position at the
moment is that the Government is not intervening in anything. The Home Secretary
cannot intervene at this stage as the matter is before the courts.<
``The Home Secretary's role is at the end of the process.''<
Pinochet was arrested on October 16 last year while recovering from back
surgery at a London clinic.<
He will not be present at Bow Street for the hearing and is under armed police
guard at a rented mansion on the exclusive Wentworth Estate, Surrey.<
A personal friend of Pinochet, Peter Schaad, said he went to the house today
but did not see him as he was resting.<
``He is not well,'' he said.<
Mr Schaad did not know if the report of a stroke was accurate or exactly what
was wrong with Pinochet.<
