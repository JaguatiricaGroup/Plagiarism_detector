PINOCHET CHARGES `MOST SERIOUS TO COME BEFORE ENGLISH COURT'<
By John Deane and Joe Butler, PA News<
Former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet stands charged with ``some of
the most serious allegations of crime ever to come before English criminal
courts,'' an extradition hearing was told today.<
On the first day of Pinochet's long-awaited formal extradition hearing,
lawyers representing the Spanish authorities detailed 35 charges against the
83-year-old one-time leader of the Chilean Junta.<
The charges, which took the clerk of the court at Bow Street Magistrates
Court, in central London, 15-minutes to read out, included allegations of
torture involving brutal beatings and burnings, the enforced use of
hallucinogenic drugs, interrogating a naked woman, and electric shock treatment
which led to victims' deaths.<
Although Pinochet, under armed police guard at a rented mansion on the
exclusive Wentworth estate in Surrey was not at court to hear the allegations
against him, his opponents and supporters gathered in large numbers in the
street outside to loudly chant their views.<
Pinochet was arrested at a private clinic in London on October 16 last year,
while recovering from back surgery, at the request of Spanish Judge Baltasar
Garzon, who has accused him a string of human rights crimes allegedly committed
during his 1973 to 1990 rule.<
Today Alun Jones QC, opening the case for the Spanish authorities, told the
court that the allegations against Pinochet ``constitute some of the most
serious allegations of crime ever to come before English criminal courts''.<
Mr Jones told the court that since the Second World War, international
conventions had expanded the range of crimes considered to be wrongs against the
whole international community to include genocide, hijacking, hostage-taking and
torture.<
The 1984 Convention Against Torture, ratified by Spain, Chile and the UK, had
been incorporated into UK law via domestic legislation.<
``We are not engaged in these proceedings in consideration to some broad,
sweeping rhetorical declarations of international intent. We are
considering...black-lettered UK law,'' said Mr Jones.<
Mr Jones argued that the ratification of the torture convention made it
``simply facile'' to argue in the modern world that these offences are a matter
for Chile and no one else.<
The House of Lords, in an earlier judgment on the Pinochet case, ruled that
Pinochet could not be extradited for torture offences pre-dating December 8,
1988, the point at which the Torture Convention became binding on Chile, the UK
and Spain.<
But Mr Jones argued that the court could examine events in Chile which
preceded that date because the impact on the families of victims tortured before
then continued long afterwards and itself amounted to a form of torture.<
Explaining the first charge against Pinochet, that between December 7, 1988
and March 12, 1990, he conspired with others to torture political opponents, Mr
Jones told the court that even after many of the torture offences were
committed, the torture was effectively continued by keeping the relatives of
some 1,100 of the ``disappeared'' in the dark as to what had happened to them.<
``It is our case that the continuing offence of conspiracy to torture after
December 1988 has,as one of its objects, that the fate of these people would
continue to be concealed from families causing severe mental pain, suffering and
demoralisation,'' said Mr Jones.<
In any event, only the first charge touches on events pre-dating early
December 1988.<
The remaining 34 charges all detail alleged offences of torture against named
individuals in Chile on dates between late December 1988 and the end of 1989.<
