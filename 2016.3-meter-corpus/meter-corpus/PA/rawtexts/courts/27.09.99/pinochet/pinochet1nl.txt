PINOCHET CHARGES `MOST SERIOUS TO COME BEFORE ENGLISH COURT'<
By John Deane and Jo Butler, PA News<
The long-awaited extradition hearing against General Augusto Pinochet today
heard that the former Chilean dictator was charged with ``some of the most
serious allegations of crime ever to come before English criminal courts.''<
At the formal committal hearing at London's Bow Street Magistrates Court, it
took a court clerk 15 minutes to read out the 35 charges on which Spain seeks to
extradite the 83-year-old general.<
Pinochet was arrested at a private clinic in London on October 16 last year,
while recovering from back surgery, at the request of Spanish Judge Baltasar
Garzon, who has accused him a string of human rights crimes allegedly committed
during his 1973-1990 rule.<
Judge Garzon's allegations included accounts of brutal beatings, burnings,
partial asphyxiation, victims being held naked and hooded, confined in narrow
cubicles unable to move and suspended by their arms, and often fatal electric
shock treatment.<
Other victims had electric shocks directed at open wounds and their genitals.
Some were forced to play Russian roulette.<
One victim was subjected to such intensive torture that he threw himself to
his death from the fifth floor of the headquarters of Pinochet's feared
intelligence service, the CNI - the Centre for National Information - which
replaced the equally feared DINA intelligence network in 1977.<
Pinochet, under armed police guard at a rented mansion on the exclusive
Wentworth estate in Surrey, was not at court.<
But his opponents and supporters gathered in large numbers in the street
outside the court to chant their views on his plight.<
And inside, the general's protestations of innocence were relayed effectively
to the court by Detective Inspector Andrew Hewitt, of the Metropolitan Police's
extradition unit.<
DI Hewitt told the court how, after Home Secretary Jack Straw authorised the
continuation of the extradition proceedings in mid-April, he executed a full
arrest warrant on Pinochet at the Wentworth mansion on April 16.<
Pinochet, DI Hewitt told the court, replied: ``Yes, I don't agree with this, I
had absolutely nothing to do with any of these charges. All these charges - I
completely negate them.<
``I am being humiliated. I am a general, 64 years service, I'm a gentleman who
knows about honour. Don't worry I'm not going to comply with this, that's it.''<
Alun Jones QC, representing the Spanish authorities, said the accusations
``constitute some of the most serious allegations of crime ever to come before
English criminal courts''.<
Pinochet faces one count of conspiracy to torture, and 34 of specific cases of
torture against individuals, dating from late December 1988 to the end of
December 1989.<
Explaining the first charge against Pinochet, that between December 7, 1988
and March 12, 1990, he conspired with others to torture political opponents, Mr
Jones acknowledged that the Law Lords had ruled previously that because of
international treaty requirements only charges relating to dates after December
1988 could be considered for extradition.<
But, he argued, it was necessary to look to events before that, as Pinochet
had been party to a conspiracy which began with his military coup in 1973 and
continued to the present day, in so far as the ``disappeared'' - political
opponents who vanished during his reign and are presumed dead - were still
missing.<
In addition, Mr Jones argued, the torture was effectively perpetuated by
keeping the relatives of some 1,198 of the ``disappeared'' in ignorance as to
their fate, effectively subjecting them too to a form of torture.<
Mr Jones told the Deputy Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ronald
Bartle that it was not his role to decide whether Pinochet was guilty, nor did
Spain have to prove there was a case to answer.<
The present hearing simply had to assess whether Pinochet was accused of an
extraditable crime.<
Clive Nicholls QC, for Pinochet, told the court that when he opened the
defence case tomorrow, he would argue that Pinochet was not responsible for the
alleged crimes.<
He would argue also that there was no real evidence to implicate Pinochet in
the alleged crimes; that the accusations were ``politically motivated''; and
that Spain had no jurisdiction in the case, a specific point on which, he would
argue, he was entitled to call evidence.<
Earlier, Mr Jones argued that the Spanish courts had already established that
they did have jurisdiction.<
The hearing, expected to last five days, was adjourned until tomorrow.<
