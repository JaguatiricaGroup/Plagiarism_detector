RIVAL PROTESTS AS PINOCHET HEARING BEGINS<
By Jo Butler and John Deane, PA News<
There were stormy scenes outside Bow Street Magistrates Court in London today
as the long-awaited formal extradition hearing for General Augusto Pinochet
finally got under way.<
Rival camps of demonstrators - some backing the general's extradition to
Spain, others supporting his return to Chile - massed outside the courtroom.<
Waving banners and chanting slogans, the opposite sides were separated by a
narrow buffer zone, secured by Metropolitan Police officers.<
Today's formal proceedings come almost a year after the former Chilean
dictator was arrested in a London hospital after Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon
launched a bid for him to stand trial in Spain for human rights abuses during
his 17-year regime.<
The general's lawyers were expected to challenge Spain's right to try the
dictator because none of his alleged victims was Spanish.<
They may also question the legality of moves to add to the charges against the
general in the wake of the Law Lords' ruling in March which dismissed 29 of the
original 32 charges he faced.<
The general's supporters, who were in the majority outside the courtroom, fear
he may die in Britain before the case is resolved.<
Also at the courtroom were more than 90 journalists along with film crews and
photographers representing news organisations around the world, despite the fact
that the general is not due to attend.<
Human Rights Watch, a campaign group, described today's proceedings as
``historic''.<
Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, which took part in the
hearings before the House of Lords earlier this year, said: ``Pinochet's victims
have waited 25 years for this historic moment.<
``For the Crown prosecutors to formally read out the charges of torture and
conspiracy against General Pinochet is a measure of vindication for the
thousands who were killed, tortured or disappeared by his regime.''<
