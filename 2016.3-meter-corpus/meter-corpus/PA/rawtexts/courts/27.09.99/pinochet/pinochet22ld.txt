            13:21 27/09/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet 2nd Lead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The extradition hearing is due to last five days and the complexity of the legal
arguments to be addressed was evident from the outset.<
As soon as it began at 10.30am the two sides disputed the range of material
which the Deputy Chief Stipendiary Magistrate, Ronald Bartle, was entitled to
consider.<
Clive Nicholls, QC, for Pinochet, argued that Mr Bartle was confined to
considering only the allegations and supporting documentation contained in the
original Spanish extradition request dated November 3 last year.<
Mr Nicholls also argued that Mr Bartle could not take into account allegations
against Pinochet which related to events pre-dating December 8, 1988.<
He further argued that the prosecution would have to produce evidence that
Pinochet was in fact responsible for the acts alleged against him.<
But Mr Jones argued that Mr Bartle was entitled to consider a much wider range
of material, specifically that he could consider new torture and conspiracy to
torture allegations presented by Spain since the Home Secretary Jack Straw
authorised the continuation of the extradition process in mid-April.<
Although Mr Nicholls suggested that these issues be considered at the outset,
Mr Bartle effectively postponed making a decision, ruling that these were
matters he could deal with in his judgment at the proceedings' conclusion.<
Earlier, before proceedings got under way, representatives of Pinochet's
opponents and supporters had their say on the merits of the proceedings outside
the court.<
Juan Garces, a Spanish-based lawyer representing Pinochet's victims, welcomed
the start of the extradition hearing.<
``The most important thing is that for the first time a head of state is the
subject of an extradition hearing. It's a positive step for humanity,'' said Mr
Garces.<
However Peter Schaad, a London-based Swiss businessman who is a supporter of
the general, insisted: ``It is most ironic that Spain, the alma mater of
fascism, should ask for the extradition of Pinochet.''<
Mr Schaad said that the judge should concern himself instead with the million
or so people who have died for political reasons in Spain.<
``Garzon has to learn that colonialism died as far as Chile is concerned many
years ago. Spain needs people like Garzon like a hole in the head,'' he added.<
