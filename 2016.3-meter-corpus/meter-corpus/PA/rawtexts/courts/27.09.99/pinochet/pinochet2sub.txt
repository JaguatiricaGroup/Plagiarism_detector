           10:02 27/09/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
As at the previous hearings in the long-running legal saga, both sides were
eager to voice their point of view.<
Juan Garces, a Spanish-based lawyer representing the families of Pinochet's
alleged victims, described the opening of the extradition hearing as a highly
significant occasion.<
``The most important thing is that for the first time, a head of state is the
subject of an extradition hearing. That's a positive step for humanity.''<
Mr Garces insisted that if the general were to be extradited he would receive
a fair trial in Spain.<
``He will have a judgment with all guarantees,'' he said, adding: ``The
Spanish request is very solid in terms of law and fact. There is a strong
case.''<
One of Pinochet's prominent supporters, London-based Swiss businessman Peter
Schaad, also present at court, had a very different view of the merits of the
entire process.<
``It's most ironic that Spain, the alma mater (benign mother) of fascism
should ask for the extradition of Pinochet. I don't understand why (Judge)
Garzon doesn't concentrate on the million or so people who died for political
reasons in his own country.<
''Garzon has to learn that colonialism died in Chile many, many years ago.
Spain needs people like Garzon like a hole in the head.''<
