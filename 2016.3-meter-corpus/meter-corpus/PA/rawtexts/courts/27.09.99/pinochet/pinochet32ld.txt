            14:09 27/09/99: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet 2nd Lead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Jones said it was not the duty of the court to decide Pinochet's guilt, nor
did Spain even have to prove there was a case to answer at the court. It simply
had to assess whether the general had been accused of an extraditable crime.<
Mr Jones said although the House of Lords had ruled only charges dating from
after 1988 could be considered, it was necessary to look to events before that
to establish Pinochet has been part of a conspiracy which began in 1973 and
continued even up to the present day, in the respect that the ``disappeared''
were still missing.<
Repression in Chile was carried out by the DINA until 1977 when it was
replaced by the Centre for National Information, he said.<
Torture techniques, which continued after 1988, included beatings, bloodshed,
victims being held naked and hooded, confined in narrow cubicles so they were
unable to move and suspension by the arms.<
Victims were also semi-asphyxiated with water, had electric shocks applied to
their genitals and suffered systematic rape.<
Spanish people were among the victims, including a Spanish priest and a woman
who was eight months pregnant when she disappeared.<
Mr Jones insisted the Spanish court had already ruled they had jurisdiction on
this case. He also reminded Mr Bartle that the case had been considered broadly
and in some depth by the House of Lords. Given that the House of Lords had
considered torture and conspiracy to torture extraditable crimes it would be a
``strange circumstance'' for this court to rule otherwise.<
He said he would be explaining why extra charges had been added since the
House of Lords' decision. Briefly, his argument was that each individual case of
torture was further evidence of the conspiracy to torture. It would be
``absurd'' if that material could not also be put forward to form separate cases
of alleged torture.<
