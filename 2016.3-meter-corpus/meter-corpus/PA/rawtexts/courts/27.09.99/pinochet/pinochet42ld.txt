            16:22 27/09/99: Page 4 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet 2nd Lead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the afternoon session, Detective Inspector Andrew Hewitt, of New Scotland
Yard's extradition unit, told the court how after Home Secretary Jack Straw
authorised the continuation of the extradition proceedings in mid-April, he
executed a full arrest warrant on Pinochet on April 16.<
Det Insp Hewitt told the court how he read the allegations of torture to
Pinochet at his rented home.<
He said that Pinochet had replied: ``Yes, I don't agree with this, I had
absolutely nothing to do with any of these charges, all these charges I
completely negate them.<
``I am being humiliated. I am a general, 64 years service, I'm a gentleman who
knows about honour.<
``Don't worry I'm not going to comply with this, that's it.''<
Mr Nicholls told the court that when he opens the case for defence tomorrow,
he would argue several points.<
The first was that Pinochet ``is not responsible for the criminal conduct
which he is accused of''. <
``His hand is not on the deeds,'' said Mr Nicholls.<
He would also argue that there was no real evidence to implicate Pinochet in
the crimes alleged.<
Pinochet also argued that Spain had no jurisdiction in relation to the torture
alleged in this case.<
Mr Nicholls said that Pinochet argued that the allegations were ``politically
motivated''.<
Mr Nicholls said he would argue that he was entitled to call evidence on the
specific question of Spain's jurisdiction.<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow at 10.30am.<
