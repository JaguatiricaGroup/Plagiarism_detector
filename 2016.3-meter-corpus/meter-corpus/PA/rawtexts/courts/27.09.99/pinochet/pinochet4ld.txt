              12:05 27/09/99: Page 4 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Lead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
As soon as the hearing got under way, lawyers for each side were locked in
intense legal argument.<
They disputed the range of material which the Deputy Chief Metropolitan
Stipendiary Magistrate Ronald Bartle was entitled to consider.<
Clive Nicholls QC, for Pinochet, argued that Mr Bartle was confined to
considering only the allegations and supporting documentation contained in the
original Spanish extradition request of November 3 last year.<
Mr Nicholls also argued that Mr Bartle could not take into account allegations
against Pinochet which related to events pre-dating December 8 1988 - the
cut-off point imposed by the House of Lords in their judgment on the case in
March.<
He also told Mr Bartle that Pinochet's side would argue that the prosecution
would have to produce evidence that Pinochet was in fact responsible for the
acts alleged against him.<
Alun Jones QC, for the government of Spain, argued that Mr Bartle was entitled
to consider a much wider range of material, specifically that he could consider
new torture and conspiracy to torture allegations presented by the Spanish
authorities since Home Secretary Jack Straw authorised continuation of the
extradition process in mid April.<
Although Mr Nicholls suggested that these issues be considered at the outset,
Mr Bartle effectively postponed making a decision, ruling that these were
matters he could deal with in his judgment at the conclusion of the
proceedings.<
The clerk of the court then read out the charges against Pinochet, noting that
one of the torture charges, number 12, duplicated another, number 24. Number 12
was, therefore, deleted, reducing the total number of charges against the
general to 35.<
The process of reading out the charges took 15 minutes.<
Opening the case of the government of Spain, Mr Jones told the court that the
charges against Pinochet: ``Constitute some of the most serious allegations of
crime ever to come before English criminal courts.''<
Mr Jones argued that although most crimes are dealt with by domestic courts,
there have always been exception, such as piracy.<
And since the Second World War, a string of international conventions had
expanded the range of those crimes considered to be wrongs against the entire
international community to include genocide, hijacking, hostage taking and
torture.<
The 1984 Convention Against Torture, ratified by Spain, Chile and the UK, had
been subsequently incorporated into UK law.<
``We are not engaged in these proceedings in consideration of some broad,
sweeping rhetorical declarations of international intent. We are
considering...black-lettered UK law,'' said Mr Jones.<
Mr Jones argued that the ratification of the Torture Convention made
it``simply facile to argue in the modern world that these offences are a matter
for Chile and no one else''.<
Turning to the first charge against Pinochet, that between December 7 1988 and
March 12 1990 he conspired with others to torture, Mr Jones told the court that
a key contention was that even after the worst years of the Pinochet regime, the
general and his colleagues were determined that the relatives of some 1,100
``disappeared'' opponents should never know what had happened to them.<
``It is our case that the continuing offence of conspiracy to commit torture
after December 1988 had, as one of its objects, that the fate of those people
would continue to be concealed from families causing severe mental pain,
suffering and demoralisation,'' said Mr Jones.<
