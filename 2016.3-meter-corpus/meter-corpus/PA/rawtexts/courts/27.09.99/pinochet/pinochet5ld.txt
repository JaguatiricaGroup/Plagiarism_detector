              12:31 27/09/99: Page 5 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Lead
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Jones stressed there was no legal requirement for the Spanish government to
produce evidence in support of its case at this stage in proceedings.<
He said: ``It must be emphasised that despite the interest these proceedings
are exciting, we are not here to determine whether General Pinochet is or is not
guilty. We are not even here to determine whether there is evidence of General
Pinochet's guilt.<
``Your function, and limited function, is to determine whether he is accused
of these extradition crimes.''<
It made no difference that they were described differently by Spanish law,
which spoke of genocide and terrorism rather than conspiracy to torture.<
The prosecutor also told the court that in the light of the House of Lords'
ruling earlier this year only one accusation of torture was necessary to justify
extradition.<
Mr Jones added he did not believe the prosecution had to show the torture was
systematic and widespread, although the evidence was there to support such a
claim.<
