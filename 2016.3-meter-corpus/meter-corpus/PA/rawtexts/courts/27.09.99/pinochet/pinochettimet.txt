CATALOGUE OF THE PINOCHET DRAMA<
By John Deane, Chief Reporter, PA News<
General Augusto Pinochet ruled Chile until 1990 after leading a military coup
in September 1973 which overthrew the Communist government of President Salvador
Allende.<
During the 17 years of his rule thousands of people ``disappeared'' as
Pinochet ruthlessly suppressed political opponents.<
This is the timetable of Pinochet's detention in London:<
1998<
:: September 21 - Pinochet, aged 82, flies to Britain, suffering back problems
en route.<
:: October 9 - Undergoes back surgery at the London Clinic, near Harley
Street.<
:: October 16 - Arrested in hospital shortly before midnight. Spanish judge
Baltasar Garzon had requested his detention in connection with disappearances
and murders of Spanish nationals in Chile.<
:: October 28 - The High Court rules the 82-year-old is ``entitled to immunity
as a former sovereign from the criminal and civil process of the English
courts.'' He remains under arrest pending a House of Lords appeal.<
The then Attorney General John Morris QC declines consent for a UK
prosecution, citing ``insufficient admissible evidence''.<
:: October 29 - Pinochet is moved to a private psychiatric hospital,
Grovelands Priory Hospital, Southgate, north London.<
:: November 11 - Formal extradition request from Madrid arrives on Jack
Straw's desk. It implicates Pinochet in around 3,000 deaths.<
:: November 25 - On his 83rd birthday, the Law Lords, in a three-to-two
judgment, overturn the High Court's earlier decision and rule he is not immune
from arrest.<
:: December 1 - Pinochet moves to a house on the exclusive Wentworth estate in
Surrey.<
:: December 9 - Home Secretary Jack Straw rules that Pinochet must remain in
England to face the extradition process.<
:: December 11 - Pinochet tells Belmarsh Magistrates' Court in south-east
London that he does not recognise the right of any court outside Chile to hear
``all the lies of Spain''.<
:: December 17 - The Law Lords agree to reconsider whether or not Pinochet has
immunity. Pinochet's lawyers had accused Lord Hoffmann, one of the original
panel of judges, of allowing a ``real danger of bias'' into the original
hearing, because of his long-standing relationship with Amnesty International.<
<
1999<
:: February 4 - The Law Lords retire to consider their ruling on February 4,
after a new hearing lasting 12 working days.<
:: February 18 - It emerges that in November the Vatican made representations,
apparently sympathetic to Pinochet, to the Foreign Office.<
:: March 24 - By a 6-1 majority, the Law Lords again overturn the High Court's
October 28 decision that Pinochet enjoyed blanket immunity. But the panel
drastically reduces the number and range of charges. Chairman Lord
Browne-Wilkinson says Pinochet cannot be extradited for tortures committed in
Chile before late 1988 _ when the Criminal Justice Act 1988 made torture an
``extraterritorial'' crime under British law. He says Pinochet can be
extradited, but ``only for the extradition crimes of torture and conspiracy to
torture alleged to have been committed after December 8, 1988'' - when the
international Torture Convention - incorporated into British law by the Criminal
Justice Act - became binding on Spain, the UK and Chile.<
:: March 25 - Judge Garzon files new torture counts. Baroness Thatcher meets
her old friend and ally Pinochet at Wentworth.<
:: April 15 - Issuing a new Authority to Proceed, Jack Straw says that the
remaining charges of torture and conspiracy to torture are serious enough to be
extraditable, and there are no compassionate grounds to halt the proceedings.<
:: May 19 - Pinochet is taken to Princess Margaret Hospital, Windsor,
Berkshire, for a prearranged consultation after suffering pain in the lower
abdomen area.<
:: May 26 - Pinochet leaves his rented mansion for a routine check-up on his
vision.<
:: May 27 - The High Court declines Pinochet's lawyers permission to seek
judicial review of Mr Straw's decision to allow extradition to proceed.<
:: June 8 -  Baroness Thatcher pays a second visit to the general.<
:: July 1 - Judge Garzon adds another 22 torture cases to the indictment.
Since the Lords' March 24 ruling, Garzon has added nearly 100 post-1988 torture
charges to his case. The latest cases involve acts allegedly committed before
the Lords' 1988 cut-off point, though Garzon's office does not explain why.<
:: July 2 - Pinochet undergoes an electrocardiogram.<
:: July 6 - In a Lords debate, Baroness Thatcher claims that Pinochet is being
victimised ``because the organised international Left are bent on revenge''.<
:: July 8 - Pinochet is spared a massive legal bill as the Law Lords rule that
the taxpayer must meet the lion's share of the costs.<
:: July 18 - In an interview with Sunday Telegraph editor Dominic Lawson,
Pinochet describes himself as ``England's only political prisoner''.<
:: Aug 3 - Human rights campaigners voice alarm at reports that Chile's
foreign minister, Gabriel Valdes, asked his Spanish counterpart, Abel Matutues
to block the extradition bid, with Pinochet instead required to face some form
of bilateral arbitration.<
:: Sep 11 - Pinochet supporters meet him at Wentworth to pass on the ``wishes
of the Chilean people'' on the 26th anniversary of his coup.<
:: Sep 13 - Pinochet attends Wexham Park Hospital, Slough, for a brain scan.<
:: Sep 14 - Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes rejects Chile's request for
international arbitration, insisting: ``The government cannot accept the
possibility of resolving by diplomatic means or arbitration a case that is
currently being handled through the judicial process.''<
:: Sep 15 - In a letter to Chile's Senate President Andres Zaldivar, dated
September 11, Pinochet laments the violence during his dictatorship, claiming
that he had ``no hatred or rancour'' in his soul.<
:: Sep 17 - Chile temporarily recalls its ambassador to Spain to express its
displeasure over Madrid's refusal to let an arbitration panel decide Pinochet's
fate.<
:: Sep 23- Pinochet spends several hours at Princess Margaret Hospital,
Windsor, undergoing further neurological tests.<
