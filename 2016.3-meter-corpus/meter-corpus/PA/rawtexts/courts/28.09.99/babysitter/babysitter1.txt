A 13-year-old babysitter appeared in court today accused of murdering a
toddler in her care.<
The jury at Manchester Crown Court heard that 16-month-old Molly Adams died in
hospital three days after being admitted with severe head injuries last
December.<
Opening the trial, Mr Anthony Morris for the Crown said: ``At the time she
sustained those injuries she was in the sole care of the defendant in this
case.''<

than in the dock. The defendant cannot be named for legal reasons.<
