SCHOOLGIRL BABYSITTER MURDERED TODDLER, COURT TOLD<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
A 13-year-old babysitter went on trial today accused of murdering a toddler in
her care.<
The schoolgirl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly killed
16-month-old Molly Adams by severely fracturing her skull, Manchester Crown
Court heard.<
The teenager, who denies the charge, was looking after the child in Crumpsall,
Manchester, in December last year, when the incident happened.<
Initially she told neighbours and police she had no idea how the injuries were
caused.<
Later she said Molly had fallen from her arms as she tried to comfort her.<
In his opening speech Anthony Morris QC, for the prosecution, rejected the
explanation and said all the girl's versions of events were untrue.<
He said: ``The prosecution witnesses have never seen injuries of this severity
caused by a fall of about five feet from a carer's arms.<
``The majority of children that fall - because accidents do happen - in this
sort of way do not suffer skull fractures at all.<
``On occasions there may be fine line fractures but there is no underlying
blood or brain damage.<
``This was not a single linear fracture - it was a major complex fracture some
18 centimetres long.''<
Molly's mother Annette Adams wept as she told the jury of six men and six
women that she had trusted the girl to look after her daughter on the night of
December 4 last year.<
She said the defendant, who was 12 at the time, was mature for her age, and
knew to contact Molly's aunt Janet, who lived opposite, if she woke up.<
Ms Adams, a single mother, bathed Molly and settled her for the night before
leaving the house to visit a friend at around 8.30pm.<
The babysitter left Molly to see if two brothers from a neighbouring house
wanted to watch a video with her. But when their father refused she returned.<
At 10pm she knocked on the door of Janet Adams and told her there was
something wrong with Molly.<
The pair ran back to Molly's bedroom where she was found in her cot with blood
coming from her nose.<
Her face was white with dark purple patches on it.<
Janet Adams told the court: ``She looked so perfect but I knew she was dead.<
``I took her out of the cot and she was limp. I ran down the stairs cradling
her in my arms.''<
Neighbours tried to revive Molly before the ambulance arrived to take her to
Booth Hall Children's Hospital, where she died three days later.<
A post-mortem examination revealed an 18cm fracture to her skull, and other
bruising consistent with her head hitting a wall or carpeted floor.<
Blood was found on the skirting boards on the landing and on the door leading
to her bedroom.<
Mr Morris told the court, that the defendant told police and neighbours that
she had no idea how the injuries were caused.<
A week later she changed her story, he said.<
``She said Molly jerked back and fell out of her arms. She banged her head on
the wall then fell head first down two stairs.''<
The court was following new guidelines on dealing with juveniles and the girl,
wearing her school uniform, sat next to her solicitor rather than in the dock.
The girl's grandmother also sat on the defence bench.<
Judge Rhys Davies sat without his robes in line with the new directive.<
The court heard that the girl told police Molly appeared unhurt after the fall
and had been put back to bed.<
She did not tell anyone what had happened because she was scared of being
shouted at.<
The trial was adjourned until Thursday.<
