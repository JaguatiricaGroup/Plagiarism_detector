Neighbours called an ambulance and a crash team were put on standby at Booth
Hall Children's Hospital.<
Doctors discovered a large swelling on the back of the toddler's head, which
was visibly growing, a black eye, and other bruises.<
Mr Morris said the jury of six men and six women will hear experts say
``considerable force'' was needed to create such injuries.<
The child was put on a ventilator and admitted to intensive care in a critical
condition.<
On December 7 1998 the machine was turned off due to the irreversible amount
of brain damage she had suffered.<
A post-mortem examination revealed an 18cm gaping fracture to Molly's skull
consistent with her head hitting a wall or carpeted floor.<
Blood was found on the landing skirting boards and on the door to her
bedroom.<
Mr Morris said that after the incident the defendant changed her story.<
At first she told neighbours and police that she had no idea how the injuries
were caused.<
A week later she said Molly had slipped from her arms as she carried her
downstairs to comfort her.<
Mr Morris added: ``She said that Molly jerked back and fell out of her arms.
She banged her head on the wall then fell head first down two stairs.''<
The defendant then told police that the child appeared unhurt and that she put
her back to bed.<
She said she did not tell anybody what had really happened because she was
scared of being shouted at.<
Mr Morris said: ``The Crown say all the versions of the defendant's version of
events were untrue.<
``The prosecution witnesses have never seen injuries of the severity caused by
a fall of about 5ft from a carer's arms.<
``The majority of children that fall - accidents do happen - in this sort of
way do not suffer skull fractures at all.<
``On occasions there may be fine-line fractures but there is no underlying
blood or brain damage.<
``This wasn't a simply linear fracture it was a major complex fracture some
18cms long.''<
