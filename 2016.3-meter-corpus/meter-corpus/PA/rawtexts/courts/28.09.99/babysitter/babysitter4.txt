Single mother Annette Adams, 26, wept as she told the jury how she trusted the
babysitter with her daughter.<
She said the defendant was very mature for her age and said she had told her
to contact the toddler's aunt or grandmother if she woke up.<
Also giving evidence Ms Adams's sister Janet said: ``Molly was in her cot
there was blood in a patch under her nose. She looked so perfect but I knew that
she was dead.<
``I took her out of the cot and she was limp. I ran downstairs with her
cradling her in my arms.''<
Ms Adams said that she took Molly to a neighbours because she did not want to
upset her own mother who had already lost a child.<
