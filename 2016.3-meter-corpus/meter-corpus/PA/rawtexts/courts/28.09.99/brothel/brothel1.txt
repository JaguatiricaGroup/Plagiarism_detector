DOCTOR WHO RAN BROTHEL TO PAY BILLS JAILED<
By Melvyn Howe, PA News<
A woman doctor who set up a brothel to pay the bills was jailed for three
months today.<
Helped by her husband, Oksana Ryniekska, 31, was so successful at her
newprofession that she soon had nine prostitutes working for her and was raking
in more than #4,000 a week.<
Officers who posed as punters to visit the thriving bordello above an east
London dry cleaners were offered a variety of sexual services costing up to #80
an hour.<
Because all the prostitutes came from Eastern Europe and could not understand
a word of English, Ukranian-born Ryniekska was on hand to helpfully translate
basic requirements, London Southwark Crown Court heard.<
An added feature of the lucrative business, which advertised in a string of
newspapers, was home visits.<
``But they cost a little more,'' explained Christopher Hehir, prosecuting.<
He told the court that in the eight months the brothel operated it made more
than #130,000, with half going to her and half going to the girls.<
Ryniekska's share, he said, was put at #66,280.<
David Hislop, defending, said the single count of controlling prostitution
between April and November last year, which his client had admitted, amounted to
``a tragic fall from grace.''<
He told Judge Peter Jackson that by the time she had graduated in her native
country in 1994, her husband had abandoned her, leaving her to raise a young
daughter on her own.<
``It was soon obvious that a lot of a doctor in the Ukraine was a very, very
poor one and she became seduced by the opportunity of earning very much more
money by working in the UK as a doctor.''<
But she failed to get a job and after a ``whirlwind romance'' and a second
marriage, she was desperate for cash.<
The vice trade seemed the only answer to her difficulties.<
But she was now ``deeply ashamed'' of what she had done and dreaded having to
tell her retired parents back home.<
Passing sentence the judge told Ryniekska, of Green Lane, Goodmayes, Dagenham,
Essex, that it was an ``extraordinary story of a person from a very good
background with a fine education opening a brothel in financial desperation.''<
But the fact remained what she had done was ``nothing short of outrageous ...
and a particularly bad offence as you are a young woman yourself and also a
qualified medical doctor.''<
There was no option but to impose immediate imprisonment.<
Imposing an #18,994 confiscation order against her, the judge added he would
also be recommending that she be deported at the end of her sentence.<
Ryniekska's husband, Andre, also 31, whose role was limited to giving
occasional lifts to prostitutes, received a three month sentence suspended for
two years for the one count of living on prostitution, which he hadpleaded
guilty to.<
