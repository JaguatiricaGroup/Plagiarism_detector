EX-HEAD CLEARED OF FIVE SEX ASSAULT CHARGES<
By Graeme Paterson, PA News<
A former private school headmaster accused of sexually abusing pupils as they
slept in their dormitory beds was today cleared of five of the charges levelled
against him.<
David Cassell, 56, was alleged to have assaulted two boys and two girls at St
Michaels Preparatory School in Tawstock, near Barnstaple, Devon, between 1977
and 1982.<
The first offences allegedly involved a nine-year-old girl who was assaulted
once a month for two years, Bournemouth Crown Court heard.<
The second victim was said to have been assaulted during a school trip to
watch Somerset play cricket in 1978 when he was 11.<
After deliberating for more than 11 hours, a jury of seven women and five men
acquitted Cassell of five indecency and indecent assault charges.<
The defendant still faces five further sexual abuse charges relating to a
second girl and an 11-year-old boy who was said to be so upset by what happened
that he ran away from the school.<
Cassell, who is no longer in charge of the school but still lives in the area,
denied the allegations, saying he was ``amazed and flabbergasted'' at what had
been suggested by the former pupils.<
``I could not believe what I was hearing, because the events did not occur. It
has all come as a complete shock - it is hard to get it into one's head to be
honest,'' he told the court.<
``It is a possibility they have got together and made these allegations up
between them to get back at me in some way,'' he added.<
Judge Samuel Wiggs adjourned the two-week-long trial until tomorrow when the
jury will resume deliberating the remaining five charges.<
Cassell was released on bail.<
end<
