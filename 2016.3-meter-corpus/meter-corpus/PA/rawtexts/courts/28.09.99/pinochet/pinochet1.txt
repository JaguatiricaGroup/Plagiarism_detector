CASE AGAINST PINOCHET IS `FLAWED' CLAIM LAWYERS<
By John Deane, Chief Reporter, PA News<
General Augusto Pinochet's lawyers were today seeking to persuade a court that
Spain's extradition bid for the former Chilean dictator was fundamentally
flawed.<
The 83-year-old's lawyers were making the case on the second day of the
long-awaited extradition hearing at London's Bow Street Magistrates' Court.<
On Monday, lawyers representing the Spanish authorities told the court that
the general faced 34 torture charges and one of conspiracy to torture, and that
together they constituted ``some of the most serious allegations of crime ever
to come before English criminal courts''.<
Pinochet was arrested at a private clinic in London on October 16 last year,
while recovering from back surgery, at the request of Spanish Judge Baltasar
Garzon, who has accused him a string of human rights crimes allegedly committed
during his 1973-1990 rule.<
Judge Garzon's allegations included accounts of brutal beatings, burnings,
partial asphyxiation, victims being held naked and hooded, confined in narrow
cubicles unable to move, suspended by their arms, and often undergoing fatal
electric shock treatment.<
Other victims had electric shocks directed at open wounds and their genitals.
Some were forced to play Russian roulette.<
But today, Clive Nicholls QC, for Pinochet, will suggest that Pinochet's
long-standing claim, as a former head of state, to immunity from prosecution can
only be defeated by the Spanish authorities if they prove their case with
evidence.<
Mr Nicholls will argue that there is no evidence against the general and that
he is therefore entitled to claim immunity.<
Mr Nicholls will also maintain that Pinochet was not responsible for the
alleged crimes and that the accusations against him are ``politically
motivated''.<
The hearing is expected to last five days, at the end of which the Deputy
Chief Stipendiary Magistrate, Ronald Bartle, will probably reserve his decision
to a later date.<
Pinochet, under armed police guard at a rented mansion on the exclusive
Wentworth estate in Surrey, is not attending the hearing.<
