PINOCHET `PLAYED NO PART IN TORTURES', COURT TOLD<
By John Deane, Chief Reporter, PA News<
General Augusto Pinochet was not personally involved, even indirectly, with
the tortures for which a Spanish judge seeks his extradition, a court heard
today.<
The 83-year-old's lawyers told the second day of his extradition hearing at
London's Bow Street Magistrates' Court that Pinochet neither took part in the
tortures, nor did he encourage others to carry them out.<
Acting on behalf of the Spanish investigative judge Baltasar Garzon, the Crown
Prosecution Service has laid out 35 charges against Pinochet, 34 of them
allegations that individuals were tortured - some to death - and one charge
alleging that he conspired to torture political opponents.<
Though the charges relate to a period covering 1988 to 1990, Judge Garzon has
been probing accusations of thousands of human rights crimes stretching across
the 17 years of Pinochet's 1973-90 rule.<
Today Julian Knowles, for Pinochet, told the court that all the charges
against the general made it clear that the alleged tortures were carried out by
other people.<
Rather, he said, the case against the general was on basis that ``he gave the
orders, that he was a counsellor''.<
But, Mr Knowles argued, Pinochet did not bear even secondary responsibility.<
``The essential allegation against Senator Pinochet is that tortures were
committed in Chile as part of a policy that began around the time of the coup in
September 1973,'' said Mr Knowles.<
``We say it is plain that having a mere policy doesn't make you liable as a
secondary party for any act of torture, committed anywhere in Chile, by anyone,
at any time, in the subsequent 17 years.''<
Under English law, to establish secondary responsibility, there had to be
communication between the secondary party and the person directly responsible,
and some encouragement of the offence, he maintained.<
But there was nothing, Mr Knowles argued, to suggest that Pinochet even knew
the individuals who were tortured, let alone ordered their suffering.<
Earlier Clive Nicholls QC, also for Pinochet, urged the court to strike out
the overwhelming majority of the charges.<
Under the terms of the Extradition Act 1989 and the European Convention on
Extradition, he argued, the court could only concern itself with offences
described in the original extradition request, which was filed by the Spanish
authorities on November 3 last year, and which reached the Home Office on
November 11.<
He pointed out that the bulk of the charges were described in documents sent
after November 3.<
Mr Nicholls, who also maintained that Spain had failed to establish
jurisdiction, argued that the court should therefore consider only the
conspiracy charge, and one of the alleged torture offences, as they were the
only ones included in the original extradition request.<
In relation to the single allegation of torture which was included on the
original extradition request, electric shock treatment which killed 17-year-old
Marcos Quezada Yanez in June 1989, Mr Knowles later noted that this was not an
allegation which involved Pinochet's security services, but rather a local
police force.<
There was no political motive behind the incident, he argued, but it was
rather ``a simple case of police brutality'' - the kind of complaint still made
against police in Chile 10 years after the advent of democracy and also, from
time to time, against police officers in Spain and the UK.<
The highly charged political atmosphere which has surrounded the Pinochet saga
permeated the courtroom at the end of the day's session.<
Alun Jones QC, representing the Spanish authorities, told the court that he
would, later in the hearing, seek a short adjournment in order to consider new
documentation served on him by the defence team.<
The documentation, Mr Jones said, alleged that the prosecution against
Pinochet was prompted by political antagonism in Spain to Pinochet's overthrow
of the socialist government led by President Salvador Allende.<
It alleged that the prosecution was tainted by, in Mr Jones' words, ``barely
concealed political bias''.<
Mr Jones told the court that the documents alleged that Judge Garzon, while
purporting to act in a judicial capacity, was actually driven by ulterior
motives of a political character.<
Mr Jones told the court that he resented what he called ``this shabby and
underhand'' attempt to bring forward these arguments at such a late juncture.<
Earlier, Mr Nicholls declined an invitation from Mr Jones to call Pinochet to
give evidence to support the contention that the prosecution was politically
motivated, saying that it would serve no useful purpose.<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.<
