COURT SHOULD STRIKE OUT MOST CHARGES, SAYS PINOCHET QC<
By John Deane, Chief Reporter, PA News<
General Augusto Pinochet's lawyers today urged the court hearing extradition
proceedings against him to strike out the overwhelming majority of the torture
charges against the former Chilean dictator.<
On the second day of the hearing at Bow Street Magistrates' Court in central
London, they argued that the court could not consider allegations filed from
Spain after the Spanish launched their original extradition request, which was
filed on November 3 last year and which reached the Home Office on November 11.<
Acting on behalf of the Spanish investigative judge, Baltasar Garzon, the
Crown Prosecution Service has laid out 35 charges against Pinochet, 34 of them
torture allegations and one of conspiracy to torture.<
Garzon is investigating allegations of numerous human rights crimes relating
to Pinochet's 1973-90 rule.<
But today Clive Nicholls QC, for Pinochet, argued that under the terms of the
Extradition Act 1989 and the European Convention on Extradition, the court could
only concern itself with offences described in the original extradition
request.<
He pointed out that the vast bulk of the charges against 83-year-old Pinochet
were described in documents sent through diplomatic channels from Spain to the
UK after November 3.<
Mr Nicholls argued that the court should therefore consider only the
conspiracy charge, and one of the alleged torture offences, as they were
included in the original extradition request.<
``Extradition may only be ordered for conduct described in the formal request
for extradition submitted in accordance with the Act and Convention, and
considered and taken into account by the Secretary of State (Home Secretary) -
that is the document dated November 3,'' Mr Nicholls told the court.<
