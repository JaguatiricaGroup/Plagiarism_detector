12:29 28/09/99: Page 2 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Nicholls argued that when Home Secretary Jack Straw issued an Authority to
Proceed - the document authorising the extradition process - he made it clear
that his decision was based firmly on the original extradition request on
November 3.<
The House of Lords, in reaching its landmark ruling on the Pinochet affair on
March 24, had likewise made it clear that the extradition was to proceed only in
respect of the conspiracy charge and the single torture offence, Mr Nicholls
claimed.<
``This attempt by Spain to add further charges flouts the Act and
Convention,'' he said.<
Earlier, Alun Jones QC, representing the Spanish authorities, took issue with
an assertion, made yesterday, that General Pinochet felt he was the victim of a
prosecution that was politically motivated, but that the format of the current
hearing prevented him from making out that case.<
Mr Jones told the court: ``We don't want the defence to feel that the
defendant's hands are tied behind his back. I take the view that the evidence of
General Pinochet would be admissible on this point. He could, if he wished, give
evidence on that point.''<
The Deputy Chief Stipendiary Magistrate, Ronald Bartle, said that in his view
Pinochet could give evidence to back up his view that the prosecution was
politically motivated if he so wished.<
``There is a right on the part of the defence to call evidence as to whether
the offence is a political offence,'' said Mr Bartle.<
However, Pinochet's legal team gave no immediate indication as to whether it
was a right which they intended to take up.<
