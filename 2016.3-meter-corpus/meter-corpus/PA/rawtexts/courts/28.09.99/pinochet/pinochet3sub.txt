13:29 28/09/99: Page 3 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Nicholls argued that the Spanish authorities had failed to establish
jurisdiction over the crimes they had alleged.<
``What is not established is that Spain has jurisdiction - these alleged
crimes were not committed in Spain, the senator (Pinochet) is not a Spaniard,
and none of the victims are Spanish. Nor is the senator in Spain,'' Mr Nicholls
noted.<
Mr Nicholls also argued that there was insufficient information in the Spanish
extradition request to establish that Pinochet was responsible for the crimes
alleged.<
``No-one suggests that Senator Pinochet's hands are in fact on any of these
acts.<
``No-one suggests he was personally involved,'' said Mr Nicholls.<
General Pinochet, who is under armed police guard at a rented mansion on the
exclusive Wentworth Estate in Surrey, is not attending the extradition hearing.<
