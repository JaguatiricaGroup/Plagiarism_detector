15:50 28/09/99: Page 4 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the afternoon session Julian Knowles, also for Pinochet, argued that all the
charges against the general made it clear that the alleged tortures were carried
out physically by other people.<
``It is clear that Senator Pinochet is not accused in Spain of being a
principal, of actually having had his hand on the act,'' said Mr Knowles.<
Mr Knowles told the court: ``The case is that he gave the orders, that he was
a counsellor.''<
But, Mr Knowles argued, Pinochet did not bear even secondary responsibility
for the tortures.<
``The essential allegation against Senator Pinochet is that tortures were
committed in Chile as part of a policy that began around the time of the coup in
September 1973.<
``We say it is plain that having a mere policy doesn't make you liable as a
secondary party for any act of torture, committed anywhere in Chile, by anyone,
at any time, in the subsequent 17 years.''<
Under English law, to establish secondary responsibility, there had to be some
element of communication between a secondary party and the person directly
responsible for the offence, and some element of encouragement of the offence,
said Mr Knowles.<
Senator Pinochet would have had to have aided, abetted, counselled or procured
the tortures, and to have had some foreknowledge of the crimes.<
But there was nothing, Mr Knowles argued, to suggest that Senator Pinochet
knew the individuals who were tortured; approved of specific acts of torture;
encouraged others to carry out tortures; that he gave orders, directly or
indirectly for torture to be carried out; or that he had any motive to want
people to be tortured.<
In relation to the single allegation of torture which was one of the original
extradition requests, electric shock treatment which killed 17-year-old Marcos
Quezada Yanez in June 1989, Mr Knowles noted that this was not an allegation
which involved Pinochet's security services, but rather a local police force.<
There was no political motive behind the incident but it was rather ``a simple
case of police brutality'' - the kind of complaint still made against police in
Chile 10 years after democracy and also, from time to time against police
officers in Spain and the UK.<
