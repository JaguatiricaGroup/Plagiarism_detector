16:34 28/09/99: Page 5 (HHH) COURTS Pinochet Substitute
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the conclusion of today's session, Mr Jones told the court that he would, in
due course, seek a short adjournment in order to have time to consider new
documentation served on him by the defence team.<
The documentation, Mr Jones said, alleged that the prosecution against
Pinochet was prompted by political antagonism in Spain to Senator Pinochet's
overthrow in 1973 of the socialist government led by President Allende. It also
alleged that the prosecution was tainted by, in Mr Jones' words, ``barely
concealed political bias''.<
Mr Jones told the court that the documents alleged that the request was from
an investigating magistrate, Judge Garzon, who was purporting to act in a
judicial capacity but he was actually driven by ulterior, nefarious motives of a
political character.<
Mr Jones said he acknowledged that the Pinochet case had involved some legal
``rough and tumble'', but he told the court that he resented what he called
``this shabby and underhand'' attempt to bring forward such arguments at such a
late point in the proceedings.<
The hearing was adjourned until 10.30am tomorrow.<
