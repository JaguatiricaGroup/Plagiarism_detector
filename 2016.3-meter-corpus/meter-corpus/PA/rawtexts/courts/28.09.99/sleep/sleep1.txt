RE-TRIAL ORDERED AFTER MAGISTRATE FALLS ASLEEP<
By Adam Jankiewicz, PA News<
A man's conviction in an alleged road rage case has been quashed after a
magistrate fell asleep during his trial, it was disclosed today.<
Timothy Price, 26, must face a re-trial next month after his solicitor
reported the incident during the hearing at Witney Magistrates Court in
Oxfordshire.<
The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed today that a new trial would take
place after an internal investigation at the court found the claim to be true.<
The sleeping magistrate has not been identified.<
Price, of Windmill Road, North Leigh, Oxon, was convicted of causing fear and
provocation of violence in July following an alleged road-rage incident in
Witney's Woolgate Centre car park.<
He was fined #500 and ordered to pay #300 in compensation.<
His solicitor Tim Brown, of Oxfordshire firm Brown and Pajak, said today: ``A
magistrate fell asleep and had to be woken up. I noticed it and we pointed it
out to the court clerk later.<
``They held their own investigation and found it was true. It is only fair to
have a re-trial.''<
Mrs Sandy Strover, a chief witness for the prosecution, told the Oxford Mail
that she had only recently given birth to her daughter and would not be prepared
to re-live the ordeal.<
She said: ``Giving evidence was a bad experience which I do not want to go
through again. I've only recently had an operation and have a tiny baby to look
after.<
``I am not prepared to go to court again. It's an absolute shambles and I am
furious. I feel totally let down by the system.''<
She added: ``If a magistrate fell asleep I can see the man did not have a fair
trial. But giving evidence was absolute torture.''<
Banbury Court Office, which covers Witney, had referred the matter to the Lord
Chancellor's Office.<
