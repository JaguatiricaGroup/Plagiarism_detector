ROCK STAR COLLINS SUES MUSICIANS OVER ROYALTIES<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
Rock star Phil Collins was today suing two black American members of his
former backing band, claiming he overpaid them #500,000 in royalties.<
Collins, reputed to be worth more than #300 million, wants the money back from
the founder members of the Phoenix Horns, who have flown from America to defend
the High Court action.<
Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis, once part of the legendary group, Earth,
Wind and Fire, will claim during the expected five-day legal battle that they
signed a contract giving them 0.5% of the royalties from a live album recorded
during Phil Collins's Serious tour of 1990.<
But Collins is arguing that the pair only should have received royalties for
the five tracks on which they appeared and not the whole album.<
Davis, 51, and 61-year-old Satterfield worked with Collins during the 1980s,
helping to produce several highly-successful albums, including Face Value in
1981 and But Seriously in 1989.<
The pair are being represented by the Society of Black Lawyers who said the
two black artists are impoverished and rely on royalties from the album.<
``If successful, it is highly unlikely that Collins will receive any money.
What is certain, however, is that these talented African-American artists will
be reduced to destitution with no prospect of seeing any benefit from their
labour during Collins's formative years.''<
Collins received an Oscar last Sunday for best original song, You'll Be In My
Heart, from the film, Tarzan.<
