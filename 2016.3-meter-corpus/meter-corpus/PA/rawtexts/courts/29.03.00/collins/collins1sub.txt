ROCK STAR COLLINS IN ROYALTIES COURT CASE<
By Stephen Howard, PA News<
Rock star Phil Collins today launched a High Court action against two American
members of his former backing band, claiming he overpaid them a total of
#500,000 in royalties.<
Collins, who last Sunday collected an Oscar for best original movie song,
wants to stop paying royalties to the founder members of the Phoenix Horns, who
claim they will be left destitute if they receive no more money.<
Robert Howe, representing Phil Collins Ltd, told Mr Justice Jonathan Parker
that because of an accounting error, Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis were
paid royalties on all 15 tracks of a live album recorded during the Serious tour
of 1990.<
But the contract they signed only gave them royalties on the five tracks to
which they contributed, said Mr Howe.<
Davis, 51, and 61-year-old Satterfield, once part of the legendary group
Earth, Wind and Fire, flew in from America to defend the action, claiming they
are entitled to royalties on the whole album.<
Mr Howe said no order was being sought for repayment because royalties were
stopped four years ago and the bulk of the overpayments had been recovered.<
``The claimant is not seeking to make either of the defendants put their hands
into their pockets and pay back a penny,'' said Mr Howe.<
But he said the company wanted a declaration that it did not have to pay out
any further royalties.<
Davis, of Studio City, and Satterfield, of North Collette, both in California,
worked with Collins during the 1980s, helping to produce several highly
successful albums, including Face Value, in 1981, and But Seriously, in 1989.<
