  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Howe said Davis and Satterfield were paid 2,500 US dollars a week when they
rehearsed with Collins and 5,000 US dollars a week while touring.<
He said it was ``no part of the case to disparage the defendants as
musicians''.<
``They were excellent musicians who were well rewarded for their work on the
tour.''<
Mr Howe said that what was at stake was the remaining sums Collins's company
claims the pair owed which was 20,000 US dollars a year reducing by 4,000
dollars a year from the royalties which had been withheld.<
Mr Justice Jonathan Parker commented: ``It is not much is it.''<
The judge said what the company was saying was that they had made an
accounting mistake for six years and were stopping royalty payments until it had
recouped the amount.<
``That is not a very attractive position, is it,'' he told Mr Howe.<
The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow when Davis and Satterfield are
expected to give evidence.<
Phil Collins will not give evidence.<
