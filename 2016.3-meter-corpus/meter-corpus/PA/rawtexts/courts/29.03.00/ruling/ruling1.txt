ROBBERY RETRIAL WOULD BE UNFAIR, RULES JUDGE<
By Shenai Raif, PA News<
Two men walked free from the Old Bailey today after a judge ruled that it
would not be fair for them to stand trial for a second time in view of a
corruption investigation into Flying Squad officers.<
John Woodruff, 63, and William Hickson, 56, both from east London, were jailed
for 17 years for conspiracy to rob, robbery and having firearms at the Old
Bailey in April 1997.<
But the Court of Appeal quashed the main convictions last November. The case
was then referred back to the Old Bailey where Judge Geoffrey Grigson allowed a
defence submission that it would be an abuse of process to try the men again.<
Judge Grigson said his ruling was based on ``unproven assumptions'' of
corruption by Flying Squad officers.<
The allegations were denied by the officers and were subject to disciplinary
and court proceedings.<
The defence had claimed the robbery of a Post Office in Manor Park, east
London, in 1996 was a set-up and a gun was planted on them by a Flying Squad
officer.<
The judge said the Crown wanted to excise 12 officers from the trial.<
``The jury would not be presented with the full picture but with a sanitised
version,'' he said.<
``The trial becomes unfair because the process the Crown seek to adopt may
remove the stench of corruption from the trial process.<
``It would be Hamlet without the prince.''<
