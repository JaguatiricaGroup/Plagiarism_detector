A bitter stepmother and her business partner were today each jailed for nine
years for conspiring to murder her stepson and his wife.<
Sylvia Paterson, 54, and John Holmes, 43, hired a circus clown named Banjo as
a hitman to make Paul and Sarah Paterson ``disappear'', Manchester Crown Court
heard.<
Sentencing them, Judge Sir Rhys Davies said Paterson was the driving force
behind the ``deliberate, calculated'' plot that persisted over a number of
months.<
Holmes and Paterson stood motionless in the dock, staring straight ahead as
the sentences were delivered.<
Paterson, of Woodford Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire, was described as penniless and
assetless by her lawyer before she was led to the cells.<
Her business partner Holmes, of Carrwood, Hale, Barnes, Cheshire, was
described as a ``ruined man'' by his lawyer before being led away.<
