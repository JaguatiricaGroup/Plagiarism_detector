STEPMOTHER `PLOTTED DEADLY REVENGE OF JEALOUS RIVALS'<
By Peter Beal and Jane Merrick, PA News<
Resentment burned so strongly in wealthy Sylvia Paterson that it drove her to
plot the murder of the couple she saw as her deadly rivals _ her own stepson and
his wife.<
Ever since Paterson, 55, married factory owner Kenneth Paterson, then aged 70,
in 1993, her relationship with his son Paul and his wife Sarah, had become
increasingly bitter.<
She was angry that her husband had made over his shares in the family metal
business in Marple, Greater Manchester, to his son and grandson without her
knowledge.<
And that Kenneth had allowed Paul, 38, to buy his share of his luxury home in
Wilmslow, Cheshire, and live there with his family.<
She also blamed the couple for the continuing deterioration in her marriage.<
Yet Sylvia Paterson, who rejected claims that she had been ``gold-digging''
when she married her elderly husband, was a rich and successful businesswoman
and property developer in her own right.<
She enjoyed the social life of the ``Cheshire set'', sent her son and daughter
to expensive schools, flew her own planes and ran a Mercedes saloon with the
registration CLA 55Y.<
She had her own luxurious home _ Bray Cottage in Wilmslow _ and a flat in
nearby Altrincham. She boasted of spending time in the Virgin Islands to gain
her United States private pilot's licence and of regularly jetting to the US on
Concorde.<
She had regularly flown around the globe in her previous job as personal
assistant to a wealthy Lebanese businessman, which went with a lavish clothing
allowance, school fees for her children and private health care.<
Her first marriage to Army officer David Bardsley, who she wed at 19, had
broken down with her claiming he was jealous of her success.<
Her lavish lifestyle was a far cry from her previous career as a nurse _
working at Oldham Hospital in the 1970s on the IVF programme that resulted in
the birth of the world's first test tube baby.<
Paterson met John Holmes, another property developer and businessman with many
interests, when she visited his dry cleaning firm, Park Dry Cleaners, shortly
after her divorce in 1981.<
They became friends and partners in a series of property projects.<
They attended charity functions, together with Holmes' wife Christine, and
were regularly photographed in the society magazine Cheshire Life.<
Manchester-born Holmes had been educated at Gordonstoun but shunned a career
following his father into the family tyre business.<
When it was sold out to Pirelli, Holmes bought a building off Sir James
Goldsmith and started his dry cleaning business.<
He expanded into property _ owning and renting out eight premises in Hale,
Altrincham and London, and expanded his interests into transport and taxi
firms.<
He estimated his fortune as ``two to three million pounds'' but said: ``I
never calculate it on a daily basis.''<
His luxury house in Hale Barns, near Wilmslow, houses his pride and joy _ his
#500,000 art collection which includes a David Hockney work.<
In August 1998, Holmes first hit the national news headlines. He was given a
two-month jail sentence at Mold Crown Court for indecently assaulting a
16-year-old waitress during a New Year's Eve party at the fashionable Est, Est,
Est bistro in Knutsford.<
He said afterwards: ``It was New Year's Eve. Perhaps I had gone over the top.
Everybody had been drinking. It was all merriment.<
``I was discovered with a friend of mine, this particular waitress who was 16
but looked more like 25. All we were having was a kiss and her boyfriend
discovered us.''<
It was while in Altcourse prison in Liverpool, in a wing segregated for
prisoners including sex offenders, that Holmes met Paul Thorlsog, a seasoned
petty criminal, conman and fantasist.<
He told tales of being in the SAS and having served in troublespots around the
world.<
His real background was less glamorous but more bizarre - in between
convictions for dishonesty and spells in jail he had worked in travelling
circuses as a clown. It had earned him his nickname of Banjo.<
Paterson's nine-year live-in relationship with aircraft engineer Colin Fray
foundered in 1991. Paterson had to take him to court to recover property he
refused to relinquish.<
It was in 1993, when Paterson was helping out friends behind the bar of the
Unicorn pub, that she met Kenneth Paterson, whose wife had died the previous
year.<
Despite the age difference of nearly 20 years the relationship flourished, Mr
Paterson sold his house and moved into Bray Cottage.<
But a rift developed between the couple and Paul and Sarah Paterson. <
Angry faxes were exchanged. Paterson referred to Sarah as the ``greedy wife''
and accused them of only being interested in her husband's money.<
Accusations were made over incidents in which each accused the other of
driving their luxury cars in a dangerous way to frighten and intimidate.<
Into this atmosphere of bitterness stepped Banjo the clown, newly released
from jail and taking Holmes up on a promise to supply him with work.<
Paterson was accusing husband Kenneth of having an affair. He in turn was said
to be ``insanely jealous'' of her. Paul Paterson paid a private detective, who
followed his stepmother and hacked into her bank accounts.<
At the same time, Paterson took up Holmes' suggestion that Thorlsog should be
used for the task of keeping her husband and his family under surveillance.<
It was then the plot was hatched to take Paterson's revenge on Paul and Sarah
Paterson by having them killed. Paterson suggested it should be done in such a
way that the bodies would never be found.<
Thorlsog became alarmed and decided to extricate himself from the situation.
He went to police who arranged an undercover accomplice for him and for covert
recordings to be made during meetings with Holmes. The conversations were to be
the downfall of Holmes and Sylvia Paterson.<
