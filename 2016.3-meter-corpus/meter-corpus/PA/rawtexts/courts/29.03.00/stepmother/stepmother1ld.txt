STEPMOTHER AND BUSINESS PARTNER GUILTY OF MURDER PLOT<
By Jane Merrick and Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
A bitter stepmother and her business partner were convicted today of
conspiring to murder her stepson and his wife.<
Manchester Crown Court heard that Sylvia Paterson, 55, and John Holmes, 43,
hired a semi-professional clown called Banjo as a hitman to make Paul and Sarah
Paterson ``disappear''.<
Holmes, of Carrwood, Hale Barns, Cheshire, looked at his wife, Christine, as
the verdicts were delivered following more than two days of deliberation. He was
acquitted of perverting the course of justice.<
Paterson, previously of Woodford Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire, stared straight
ahead in the dock while her son Tyrell Bardsley, 29, wept behind her in the
public gallery.<
During the trial prosecuting counsel, Anthony Gee, QC, had told the jury of
six men and six women that Paterson hatched the plot out of ``spite, ill-will
and greed'' shortly after the breakdown of her marriage to Kenneth, from whom
she is now separated.<
