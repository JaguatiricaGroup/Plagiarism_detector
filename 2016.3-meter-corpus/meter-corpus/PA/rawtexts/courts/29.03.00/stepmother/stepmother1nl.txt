PAIR JAILED OVER DOUBLE MURDER PLOT<
By Harriet Tolputt and Jane Merrick, PA News<
A bitter stepmother and her business partner were today jailed for nine years
each for conspiring to murder her stepson and his wife.<
Sylvia Paterson, 55, and John Holmes, 43, hired a circus clown known as Banjo
as a hitman to make Paul and Sarah Paterson ``disappear'', Manchester Crown
Court heard.<
Judge Sir Rhys Davies, QC, said Paterson was the ``driving force'' behind the
``calculated and deliberate'' plot.<
Paterson, of Woodford Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire, and Holmes, of Carrwood, Hale
Barns, Cheshire, stared straight ahead in the dock as the verdicts were
delivered after more than two days of deliberation.<
Holmes was cleared of perverting the course of justice.<
Paterson's 29-year-old son Tyrell Bardsley wept as he heard his mother would
be jailed. Holmes' wife Christine sat emotionless in the public gallery behind
the secure dock.<
During the seven-week trial, prosecutor Anthony Gee QC, told the jury that
Paterson had hatched the plot out of ``spite, ill-will and greed'' shortly after
the breakdown of her marriage to Kenneth Paterson, 77, last spring.<
The couple have since separated but Mr Paterson supported his wife, who
maintained her innocence throughout.<
During the trial the jury of six men and six women heard tapes of Holmes
talking to the would-be assassin Paul Thorlsog.<
Trying to cover his tracks he described bullets as ``Ruud Gullits'' and talked
of sending the Patersons to ``the warm place,'' which was taken to mean a
grave.<
Holmes also told Thorlsog he was a cocaine addict and a ``pro of the dirtiest
profession.'' <
The couple had agreed to give the part-time clown #40,000 to kill the
Patersons on their wedding anniversary last April.<
But Thorlsog, who said he always intended to ``take their money and run'',
contacted the police, who set up a covert operation to trap the pair discussing
the plot.<
Paterson resented her stepson and his wife's wealth and was bitter because her
husband had handed over a controlling interest in the family firm to them
without telling her.<
She used Holmes, a millionaire property developer who also ran a dry cleaning
business, as a ``fixer'' because he had links with the criminal world following
a four-week jail sentence for indecently assaulting a teenage waitress in August
1998.<
The judge said Paterson was the stronger character but told her accomplice:
``You John Holmes, wealthy you are, possessed of a certain charm you maybe - but
you wholly lack judgment.''<
He added: ``It is clear you were all too ready to embrace criminal
associations.<
``Therefore I regard these offences with very great seriousness indeed.''<
Passing sentence the judge said: ``The sentence that must be passed in the
case of each of you does contain within an element of deterrence.''<
Addressing Holmes he added: ``You have for a number of years enjoyed a very
comfortable life - there is no-one but yourself responsible for its
destruction.''<
Jonathan Goldberg, QC, defending Holmes, said that he was ``a man effectively
of good character now ruined both personally and professionally by this utter
motiveless madness.''<
Paterson's barrister David Lane QC, described her as being ``penniless and
assetless'' after the sale of her house.<
In a statement issued after the case to PA News, Paul and Sarah Paterson said
they were relieved the case was finally over.<
``We knew nothing of the plot to kill us until the police came to inform us.
We therefore put our future security in their hands.<
``We would like to thank the police for their unstinting support throughout.
We can now look forward to returning to a normal family life.''<
