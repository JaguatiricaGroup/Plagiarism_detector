  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the trial prosecuting counsel, Anthony Gee, QC, told the jury of six men
and six women that Paterson hatched the plot out of ``spite, ill-will and
greed'' shortly after the breakdown of her marriage to Kenneth, from whom she is
now separated.<
The court heard how Paterson resented her stepson and his wife's wealth and
had a ``frosty'' relationship with them.<
She was bitter because her 77-year-old husband had handed over a controlling
interest in his metal business to his son without telling her.<
Paterson also blamed Paul and Sarah for deterioration in her marriage and
exchanged angry letters and faxes with the couple.<
By January 1999, Paterson had had enough and wanted them killed.<
She discussed with Holmes, a millionaire property developer who was well-known
as a ``fixer'', about wanting to make them disappear.<
After seven years the couple would be declared dead and the business would go
back to Kenneth.<
Paterson also talked about making their deaths look like a murder and a
suicide.<
Holmes introduced Paterson to Banjo - real name Paul Thorlsog - that month at
his dry cleaning business, telling her he was ``your man'' to carry out the
hit.<
He had met petty criminal Thorlsog, 49, while he was in prison serving four
weeks for indecently assaulting a 16-year-old waitress.<
The business partners decided Paul and Sarah, who have two young children,
were to be killed on April 27 1999, when they would be celebrating their wedding
anniversary together.<
But two weeks before the planned murders, Thorlsog began to extricate himself
from the arrangement and contacted police after approaching the News of the
World.<
Detectives launched ``Operation Gatehouse'' and an undercover officer, known
as ``Dan'', posed as a second hitman to carry out secret recordings of Holmes
and Paterson discussing the hit with Thorlsog.<
The pair were arrested on April 28at their luxury Cheshire home.<
During the trial, Holmes was heard on tape talking about getting some ``Ruud
Gullitts'' - rhyming slang for bullets - and said the word ``Hit'' a number of
times.<
Holmes, who had a regular cocaine habit, boasted about being a ``pro'' of the
``dirtiest profession''.<
He also talked about someone being sent to the ``warm place'', which was taken
to mean a grave.<
Holmes protested his innocence to the jury, saying there had been no mention
of the words ``murder'' or ``kill'' and that the taped discussions referred to
Thorlsog's surveillance of Kenneth Paterson.<
In her evidence, Paterson also said she had only asked the circus clown to
follow and take photographs of her husband and a woman she suspected was having
an affair with him.<
She had paid Thorlsog #1,150 in cash in a brown envelope for surveillance
alone and not for any hit, she said.<
But after seven weeks of evidence the jury convicted her and Holmes of the
murder conspiracy.<
