The judge said the plot was ``deliberated, calculated and persisted over a
number of months''.<
Addressing Holmes and Paterson he said: ``So far as the roles which you played
in these conspiracies it is clear from what has transpired in this court that of
the two of you, Sylvia Paterson, you are the stronger character and probably the
driving force.<
``You John Holmes, wealthy as you are, possessed of a certain charm you may be
but you wholly lack judgment.''<
The judge said Holmes may have been affected by his previous time in prison
for indecent assault but nevertheless had continued to embrace the criminal
world.<
Although Banjo had never intended to carry out the double assassination, he
regarded the charges as being very serious.<
The defendants would be given equal sentences, said the judge, as although
Paterson was the driving force it was clear that Holmes was willing to organise
the double murder.<
