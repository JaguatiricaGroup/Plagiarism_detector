OASIS ALBUM TOP OF THE SECONDHAND SHOPS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Be Here Now, by rock superstars Oasis has topped a chart as the least wanted
album of the year, a survey showed today.<
The record - the fastest selling album when issued back in 1997 - tops a list
of releases most frequently passed on to secondhand shops in 1999.<
The backhanded honour for the Gallagher brothers comes in the survey, compiled
by music magazine Melody Maker, which also saw the band cropping up again at
number nine with their b-sides album The Masterplan.<
Be Here Now prompted Oasis-mania when it was launched around the world. Sales
in the UK during its first day on the shelves were more than a third of a
million on the first day and reached 696,000 within three days.<
But the album was poorly received by critics and many fans thought the long
drawn-out tracks were a shadow of the songs in the first two albums Definitely
Maybe and (What's The Story) Morning Glory?<
Rock band Kula Shaker, who split last year, were also a turn-off with music
fans, with debut album K coming second in the secondhand chart, ahead of Spiders
by Space.<
Urban Hymns, The Verve's acclaimed 1998 album which also sold in huge
quantities, cropped up at number seven.<
And even the charms of superstars like Tom Jones and Robbie Williams wear off,
the chart reveals.<
Williams' I've Been Expecting You - containing his first solo number one
Millennium - was at number 18 and Jones' covers album Reload was 19.<
The survey will appear in next week's edition of Melody Maker.<
Top 10:<
1. Be Here Now - Oasis.<
2. K - Kula Shaker.<
3. Spiders - Space.<
4. Post Orgasmic Chill - Skunk Anansie.<
5. Believe - Cher.<
6. Magic Treehouse - Ooberman.<
7. Urban Hymns - The Verve.<
8. Villa Elaine - Remy Zero.<
9. The Masterplan.<
