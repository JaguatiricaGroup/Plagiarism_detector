VICTORIA'S INTERVIEWS SET TO RAISE EYEBROWS<
Posh Spice Victoria Beckham reveals a candid side to her personality when she
hosts her first chat show, it was reported today.<
The singer, who earlier this week told television viewers that her soccer star
husband David wears her underwear, is seen interviewing guests such as
footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, James Bond star Roger Moore, presenter
Ruby Wax and even her husband.<
But it is her asides to the camera which are likely to raise eyebrows.<
The Daily Mail says that while interviewing the designer Valentino, she
launches a verbal attack on supermodel Naomi Campbell.<
``We are going to see Val,'' Mrs Beckham tells viewers. ``I'm going to ask him
if Naomi Campbell really is a complete bitch because every time I have met her
she has been a complete bitch.<
``She is a massive cow.''<
Earlier this week the 24-year-old singer told Channel 4's Big Breakfast how
her husband preferred to wear her g-strings.<
Speaking about her relationship with Beckham, Victoria said: ``He likes to
borrow my knickers.''<
During her chat show, called Victoria's Secrets to be shown on Channel 4 next
Tuesday, she says she knows nothing about football or her husband's talent for
free-kicks.<
``I do go to football sometimes,'' she says. ``I don't know the offside rule
or free kicks...or side kicks...or whatever they're called.<
``I know what he (Beckham) does. He kind of bends the ball that way or
something, you know.''<
