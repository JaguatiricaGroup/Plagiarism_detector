I'M THRILLED, SAYS STREET'S NEW ROSIE<
By Sinead McIntyre, PA News<
A nine-year-old girl was celebrating today after beating off dozens of young
hopefuls to win the part of Coronation Street's Rosie Webster.<
Helen Flannagan, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, will step into the shoes
vacated by Emma Collinge, on January 23.<
Helen, who lives with her parents and older brother and sister, said she was
delighted to have been chosen for the part and added: ``I'm thrilled to be
working with such kind people.''<
Emma announced her decision to quit the show last month after playing Sally
and Kevin's eldest daughter since she was 10 days old, telling Coronation Street
chiefs that she wanted to donate more time to her gymnastics.<
She made her farewell appearance as Rosie on New Year's Eve.<
Now Helen will take over the part of the little girl who has been at the
centre of tough storylines which saw her parents break up and Rosie become a
bully.<
Helen, who has attended the Carol Godby Theatre Workshop in Bury since she was
five, has also appeared in a number of commercials.<
A Coronation Street spokeswoman said: ``We are pleased to welcome Helen to the
cast _ she's really excited about the part I think her family have been champing
at the bit to tell people.<
``She's a very pleasant girl and we think she will fit in very well with the
rest of the cast.''<
