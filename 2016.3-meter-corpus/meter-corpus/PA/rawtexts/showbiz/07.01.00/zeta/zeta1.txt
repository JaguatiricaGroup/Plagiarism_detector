CATHERINE `TO SIGN AGREEMENT BEFORE MARRYING DOUGLAS'<
Catherine Zeta Jones is to sign a pre-nuptial agreement which will safeguard
her future husband Michael Douglas's massive fortune, it was reported today.<
The Welsh actress has agreed to sign the agreement in case the marriage fails
after Douglas paid #44 million to his former wife Diandra, according to The
Sun.<
The Hollywood actor and Ms Zeta Jones announced yesterday they are to marry.<
Douglas, 55, who spent Christmas with the 30-year-old actress in Wales, ended
months of speculation by saying: ``I am very happy to announce that I am engaged
to Catherine Zeta Jones.''<
But a source told the newspaper lawyers had been working for weeks on the
contract to protect Douglas's #180 million fortune.<
``Catherine has money she has earned from films but it pales into
insignificance compared to Michael's,'' the source told the paper.<
The Basic Instinct star was married to Diandra for 22 years and as well as the
money handed her his Californian mansion after the break-up.<
The source told the paper: ``Michael bears no animosity towards his ex-wife
and she certainly got a good deal.<
``He was keen to get the details finalised so it left him free to marry
Catherine.''<
Douglas, son of screen legend Kirk Douglas, disclosed that he proposed as the
couple celebrated the dawn of the new millennium at his home in the Rocky
Mountains, and surprised Jones with a 1920s ring from Fred Leighton.<
The ring contains a 10-carat diamond surrounded by 28 smaller stones.<
Douglas said in an announcement on his personal website: ``I proposed to
Catherine on New Year's Eve at my house in Aspen.''<
He added that the couple had not yet set any official date for the wedding,
but that they planned to marry later this year.<
