`I'M QUITTING BECAUSE BBC TV IS BORING', SAYS EDMONDS<
By Nicky Burridge, PA News<
Television presenter Noel Edmonds said today he was quitting the BBC because
he found the programmes ``too boring''.<
Edmonds, once one of the BBC's highest paid presenters, was sad to be
``throwing in the towel'' after 30 years but did not rule out a television
comeback if the right offer came along.<
Paul Pascoe, a spokesman for Edmonds, said: ``He is only 50, he has a lot of
life in him yet.''<
The departure of Edmonds _ who earned an estimated #5 million in a four year
contact to host Noel's House Party, Telly Addicts and Telly Years _ comes less
than a week after the defection of sports presenter Des Lynam to ITV.<
Mr Pascoe said: ``I know that he has not been stimulated by television for the
BBC for 18 months or two years or so. So he has decided not to extend his
contract at the end of March.<
``It is a sad day when you have belonged to an organisation for 30 years and
you feel that you want to throw in the towel.''<
 He said Edmonds would probably retire from television in the same way he
retired from radio, and that if something came along that really stimulated or
excited him he may continue.<
He added that the reasons Lynam had given for leaving the corporation ``rings
very true with what we are experiencing.''<
But sources at the BBC said Edmonds had jumped before he was pushed.<
A BBC spokesperson said the first they knew about Edmonds's decision was when
it was reported in a Sunday newspaper. But they said it was not a surprise as
his contract runs out in March.<
The spokesperson said: ``Noel has given the BBC a lifetime of great work on
radio and TV. In his time he has been a great performer and come up with some
fantastic, innovative ideas.<
``It is sad when the veterans move on but it always makes room for fresh ideas
and fresh talent.''<
Edmonds's new Saturday night programme, which is still in development with the
BBC, will still be shown in February.<
Noel's House Party was axed in March after ratings plummeted from 15 million
to 8 million.<
During his BBC career, Edmonds has hosted shows ranging from a Radio 1
breakfast show, to the children's programme Swap Shop, to the Late Late
Breakfast Show, which was taken off the air after contestant Michael Lush fell
to his death when a stunt he was rehearsing for the show went wrong.<
