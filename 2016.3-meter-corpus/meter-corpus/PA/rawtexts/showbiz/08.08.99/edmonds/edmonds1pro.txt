EDMONDS: DOGGED BY CONTROVERSY<
By Nicky Burridge, PA News<
Noel Edmonds, who brought fame to Mr Blobby, began his showbiz career aged 19
as a DJ with pop station Radio Luxembourg, after dropping out of a psychology,
sociology and philosophy course at university.<
He was 22 when he first married in 1971, to trainee physiotherapist Gill
Slater, whom he met at the London Hospital in Whitechapel. <
Gill never worked as a physiotherapist but instead became her husband's
manager, driving him hundreds of miles around the country to events.<
But as Edmonds's career flourished on radio and later on TV, his marriage
began to deteriorate and after Gill was rushed to hospital suffering from a drug
overdose, they were no longer able to hide their problems from the outside
world.<
They divorced and three years later he met Helen Soby while filming in
Maidenhead, Berks. They were married in a little kirk on the banks of Loch
Lomond in Scotland, a place they still return to for anniversaries and family
celebrations.<
Meanwhile, Edmonds success as a Radio One DJ helped him break into TV in a big
way with his Multi Coloured Swap Shop, then the Late Late Breakfast Show and
later with Noel's House Party.<
But controversy was never very far away and the death of a contestant on the
Late Late Breakfast Show was just one incident that shook Edmonds' career.<
The show was succeeded by House Party, a format that Edmonds owned, but over
the years, its popularity declined from 15 million viewers to just six million
by the time the BBC decided to axe it earlier this year.<
Behind the scenes, Edmonds is a highly successful businessman, with his Unique
Group making programmes for commercial and non-commercial television and radio
stations.<
Last year the business turned over #15 million, a figure projected to rise to
#20 million this year.<
The multi-millionaire lives in a #2.5 million Victorian mansion near
Okehampton, Devon, and travels to work in his own helicopter.<
He says he thinks the secret of the success of his second marriage is that he
is a completely different person off television to on it.<
He once said: ``I am a very possessive husband ... Helen's mine and I have a
piece of paper which says I bought her.''<
