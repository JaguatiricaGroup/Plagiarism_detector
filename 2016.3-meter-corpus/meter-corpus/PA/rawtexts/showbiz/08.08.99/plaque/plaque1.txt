HONOUR FOR COMIC DAWSON<
By Mark Benattar, PA News<
A blue plaque commemorating the life of one of Britain's favourite funny men
was being unveiled today.<
The tribute to the late Les Dawson, king of the mother-in-law joke and former
host of BBC1's Blankety Blank, will be unveiled by his close friend and comedy
partner Roy Barraclough _ better known as Coronation Street's Alec Gilroy _ at
Manchester's Palace Theatre.<
The ceremony will be followed by the unveiling of a second plaque honouring
one of Dawson's greatest influences, the late Rochdale-born variety star Norman
Evans.<
Dawson, who died in 1993, rated ITMA veteran Evans as one of the funniest
comedians of his era and regularly named him as an inspiration.<
Both comedians played Manchester theatres regularly and had many friends in
common.<
Many of the comics' friends, family and showbiz admirers, including Hi-De-Hi's
Su Pollard, Russ Abbott and Coronation Street's Liz Dawn, are due to be present,
both at the unveilings and a celebrity lunch afterwards.<
Manchester-born Les received the honour from Comic Heritage in conjunction
with his widow Tracey Dawson.<
The work of Comic Heritage combines the commemoration of Britain's strong
comedy heritage with charity fund-raising.<
Since 1991 more than 30 of Britain's finest comedians have been honoured with
blue plaques from the group, whose patron is ex-Goon Sir Harry Secombe.<
Profits from the tributes in Manchester will be donated to the local division
of Childline, as well as other national charities supported by Comic Heritage
Charitable Trust.<
