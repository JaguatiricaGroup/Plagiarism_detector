STREET STAR TELLS OF ANOREXIA HELL<
By James Lyons, PA News<
Coronation Street temptress Tracy Shaw disclosed today that she had
contemplated suicide as she battled anorexia.<
Shaw, who plays crimper Maxine in the soap, considered killing herself after
being sectioned and placed on a psychiatric wards when her weight plummeted to
just six stone.<
The crisis point came as doctors attempted to stop her completing the last
year of her degree, she told ITV's That's Esther programme.<
``Being put into a psychiatric ward with people with long-term mental illness
and who are shaking with the drugs they are taking, there's no way that you can
go in and feel normal and be OK with yourself,'' she said.<
She said she considered ending her life after hearing the story of a fellow
sufferer, named Amanda.<
Presenter Esther Rantzen asked: ``Did you ever get as low as Amanda? Did you
ever feel like killing yourself at the time?''<
``Yeah, yeah, a few times,'' the actress confessed.<
``That is what made me think I had to go into hospital because I had to get
some help.''<
The hospital treatment did not work but Shaw finally won her battle with
anorexia with the help of private counselling sessions.<
However, since joining Coronation Street she has had to endure media
speculation that the slimming disease has resurfaced along with extensive
coverage of her turbulent love life.<
And she agreed with fellow guest Will Carling, the former England Rugby Union
captain, that Britain should have a privacy law to protect people from the
press.<
``They are hounds,'' she said. ``It makes you feel like a squirrel
occasionally doesn't it?''<
