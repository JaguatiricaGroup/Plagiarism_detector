BBC BOSSES PLEDGE BUMPER SERIES FOR CASUALTY    <
By Sarah Westcott, PA News<
The BBC's flagship medical drama Casualty is set for a bumper series this
autumn with the longest run of episodes in its history, it was announced today.<
Now in its 14th year the top-rated medical soap is promising viewers 30
episodes of topical hard-hitting storylines including euthanasia and HIV.<
Several new characters have been injected into the series, along with
returning regulars such as Cathy Shipton who plays red-headed nurse Duffy and
Derek Thompson who is long-suffering A&E nurse Charlie.<
Details were announced at a press launch today at the Casualty Warehouse in
Bristol where the series is filmed.<
Executive producer Mal Young said Casualty was ``the brand leader of hospital
dramas''.<
``The show has its imitators which is the highest form of flattery,'' he said.
``This year we are responding to the fans' request for more episodes with its
longest ever run.<
``We will examine the problems that hospitals face in 1999 and 2000 and I am
hoping we take viewers on a journey into the hearts and minds of our staff.<
``We have injected some exciting new characters into the show along with some
big surprises for established stars like Charlie and Duffy.''<
Mr Young said the secret behind Casualty's ability to pull in the ratings was
its ``real heroes that people can believe in who are always facing problems and
come back for more''.<
He added: ``We have never been afraid to reinvent the show or to recapture the
original spirit inspiring the programme.''<
Series Producer Alexei de Keyser said he had an added responsibility to
viewers by taking the characters and their audience into the new millennium.<
``Casualty is different - it's got its own spirit and agenda and offers large
characters dealing with large emotions.<
``Casualty is the brand leader in medical drama and I am confident this series
keeps it there,'' he added.<
The series will be screened between September 1999 and March 2000.<
