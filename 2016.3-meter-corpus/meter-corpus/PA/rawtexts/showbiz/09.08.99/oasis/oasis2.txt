The statement, released by the band's label Creation Records, continued: ``I've
made some great friends along the way and wish everyone in the band every
success with the next album, and intend to enjoy watching the band go on to
further success in the coming years.<
``I would like to thank the band and everyone around it, especially the fans,
for making it so special. See you at the next show!''<
The band's spokesman said the departure had only been decided today but
Arthurs had been considering it over the weekend.<
``It's been discussed between them all,'' he said.<
Arthurs was a founder member of the band, which was originally formed as Rain
in Burnage, Manchester, in 1991 with drummer Tony McCarroll and bass player Paul
``Guigsy'' McGuigan.<
A new singer, Liam Gallagher, suggested a change of name and the appointment
of his brother Noel - a former roadie with Oldham band Inspiral Carpets - gave
the group a new direction.<
Bonehead's rhythm guitar playing was an integral part of Oasis' powerful
sound, but he kept a lower public profile than lead guitarist and songwriter
Noel Gallagher.<
There are no plans for a replacement, said the spokesman.<
