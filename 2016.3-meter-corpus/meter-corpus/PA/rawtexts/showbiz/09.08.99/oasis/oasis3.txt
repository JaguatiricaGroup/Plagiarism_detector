Bonehead, a father of two who lives with his wife Kate in Bowden, Cheshire, had
completed work on the band's fourth studio album, which is still being mixed.<
He joined the rest of the band in France earlier this year to work on the
sessions for the record due out next year.<
Bonehead's departure means that only McGuigan remains from the original
line-up. McCarroll was sacked in 1995 and awarded a lump sum of #550,000 earlier
this year in an out of court settlement instead of royalties.<
In February of this year the guitarist was in trouble after being arrested at
a showbiz party to celebrate the opening of the Tommy Hilfiger store in London.
He was not charged with any offence.<
Although Noel is now the band's songwriter, Bonehead - who acquired his
nickname years ago because of his thinning hair - had helped to write the tracks
in the early days.<
When they played their first gig as a quintet at the Boardwalk in Manchester
in October 1991, their set included Take Me, a song he had co-written with
Liam.<
With the fortune he has acquired through playing with the band he has bought a
#500,000 home and expensive cars including an Aston Martin with the number plate
S1SAO - which almost reads OASIS when seen through a rear-view mirror.<
