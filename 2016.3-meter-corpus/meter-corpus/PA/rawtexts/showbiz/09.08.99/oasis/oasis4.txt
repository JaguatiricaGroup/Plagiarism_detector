The band's former tour manager Ian Robertson said tonight he was shocked by
the news.<
``I thought the whole Tony McCarroll thing was a one-off and I thought Noel
had got that hard core of people around him.<
``With Guigsy, Bonehead, Liam and Alan White, who bonded together with them
very quickly and readily, I would have put money on them splitting up as a band
rather than someone leaving.''<
Robertson, who published his account of working with the band Oasis: What's
The Story? two years ago, thought the split would have been amicable.<
``The band has recorded another album and Bonehead, who has a family that he
loves, would probably be looking at touring it for the next two years.<
``Touring commitments will be discussed and he will probably be wondering `do
I really want to be away from my family for all that time?'''<
Of the guitarist he said: ``You couldn't wish to find a more easy-going guy
than Bonehead. He was very popular with the rest of the band and the crew.<
``He did his job well but there wasn't much asked of him to tell the truth but
every now and then he would a have a blues `noodle' in the studio.<
``It wasn't a case of Noel giving orders. At the end of the day the band is
Noel's vision, but it was a very organic process. Each of them chips in and
contributes.''<
