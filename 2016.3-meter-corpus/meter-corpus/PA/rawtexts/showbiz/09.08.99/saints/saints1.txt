ALL SAINTS STAR GOES TOPLESS IN MOVIE DEBUT   <
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
All Saints star Nicole Appleton is to go topless in her movie debut, her
singing sister Natalie revealed today.<
The duo along with bandmate Melanie Blatt are currently filming Honest in
which they play three armed robber sisters who pull off daring raids in Sixties
London.<
Natalie let her sister's secret slip when she was quizzed by DJ Simon Mayo
when the girls were guests on the Radio 1 roadshow at Exmouth's Esplanade this
morning.<
Mayo pressed her for gossip from the filming of the movie during an interview
and the singer blurted: ``Okay then - Nic gets her tits out.''<
Nicole, whose band performed two of their hit songs, then hid her head in her
hands.<
A Radio 1 spokeswoman said: ``She was running around the stage in
embarrassment.''<
The movie also features scenes of extras going topless - one of whom, a
15-year-old, had lied about her age it emerged last week - for a scene set at a
music festival.<
Honest is being directed by Eurythmics star Dave Stewart, based on a script he
began seven years ago. Veteran comedy writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais
worked on the screenplay.<
All Saints singer Shaznay Lewis is not appearing in the film.<
