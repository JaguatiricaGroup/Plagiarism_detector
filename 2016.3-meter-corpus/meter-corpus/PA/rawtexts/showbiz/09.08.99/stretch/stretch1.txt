`DEN AND ANGIE' IN NEW TV DRAMA<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Soap fans remember them best as Dirty Den and Angie _ and now Leslie Grantham
and Anita Dobson are once again set to play man and wife in a new TV drama.<
The couple - reunited on screen for the first time since EastEnders - are
playing career criminal Terry Green and his long-suffering wife Sam in a
four-part drama The Stretch for satellite channel Sky Premier.<
``Various television companies have been trying to get us together for
years,'' Grantham said today.<
``Anita was very sensible and so was I, by saying that the time was not
right.<
``But now the time is right and this project has come up with a script that's
absolutely brilliant.''<
More than 30 million people watched Dirty Den Watts demand a divorce from
tortured Angie in 1986, the biggest audience in British television history.<
Dobson said: ``While we were doing it I didn't have any sense of the impact we
were making.<
``It wasn't until I left that I realised how much people loved us.''<
Back then Britain had just four television channels _ now there are hundreds.<
``Television is changing and now I think channels get very excited if they get
16 million viewers,'' Grantham said.<
The Stretch, written by Stephen Leather - who created The Knock - marks a step
up in Sky's original production.<
Leather maintained he had not re-created the Den and Angie clash for the
drama.<
Dobson said: ``Sam is much more together. She doesn't dive into the bottle and
disintegrate the same way Angie did.<
``She has a happy life looking after her family, and when Terry gets arrested
everything she thought was safe and secure is under threat.''<
Grantham said: ``I'm playing another nice character, of course. It's going to
be good for both of us because we have got stuff we can get our teeth into.''<
The Stretch will be filmed in Britain and Spain from October and will be shown
on Sky Premier next year.<
