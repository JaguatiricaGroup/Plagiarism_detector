ALED JONES DUETS WITH HIMSELF<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Former child singing star Aled Jones has recorded a unique duet _ with his
13-year-old self.<
The 28-year-old singer features alongside a vocal he recorded as a soprano
chorister on the forthcoming single, Tell Me Boy.<
And now the Walking In the Air star is searching for a look-alike of him as a
teenager to star in the video when the song is released on September 6.<
He said: ``It was really strange recording the new part of the duet singing to
the voice of a young child which is actually me.<
``It seems impossible to believe that it is the same person on the track. It
will be stranger still when I come face to face with `myself' for the video.''<
The two voices were grafted together in the studio for the track, which
reflects on the understanding and knowledge adults can receive from the
innocence of children.<
The song is taken from his forthcoming album From The Heart, released on
September 20. For  for the first time two of the 16 tracks have been written by
him.<
Jones shot to fame aged 12 as a member of the Bangor Cathedral Choir when he
performed for the BBC TV series Voices From The Holy Land.<
By the age of 15 he had sold three million albums worldwide and Walking In The
Air from the animated story The Snowman made him a household name.<
He then went to the Royal Academy Of Music and won a scholarship to the
Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.<
As a young chorister he sang at the wedding of Bob Geldof and Paula Yates and
before the Royal Family, and gave a private performance to the Prince and
Princess of Wales.<
He also presented his own BBC series and presented shows on BBC Radio 2, 3 and
4. In recent years he has diversified into acting.<
Although it is thought to be the first duet of its kind, other stars have
released records assembled over many years.<
Natalie Cole duetted with the voice of her deceased father Nat King Cole for
her single Unforgettable, while the reformed Beatles added a new backing track
to John Lennon's vocals for the singles Free As A Bird and Real Love, on the
Anthology collection.<
