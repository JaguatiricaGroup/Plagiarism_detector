FRENCH AND SAUNDERS SITCOM HEADS BBC AUTUMN SCHEDULE<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Comedy duo Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders will star in their first sitcom
together on BBC1 this autumn.<
The pair's comedy sketch series brought them an army of fans, and they have
enjoyed sitcom success apart _ Saunders with Absolutely Fabulous and French with
Murder Most Horrid and Richard Curtis's The Vicar Of Dibley.<
Now they will appear together in Let Them Eat Cake, a romp written by Peter
Learmouth, described as ``murder, scandal and lots of `rumpo' involving mad
aristocrats in the court of Louis XVI''.<
Situation comedy is one of the areas highlighted for improvement by BBC
Governors in the last annual report.<
More new comedy in the #195 million Autumn schedule unveiled today will come
from Birds Of A Feather writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran in a
pre-watershed sitcom called Starting Out.<
Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash's The Royle Family graduates to BBC1 for its
second series after winning big audiences on BBC2.<
The wars of the 20th century will be marked by two dramas and a factual
series.<
David Jason, more often seen now on ITV, stars with Maggie Smith in All The
King's Men, a dramatisation of the legend surrounding the disappearance of an
entire company at Gallipoli in the First World War.<
Real-life testimony about the crucial months of 1940 in the Second World War
will feature in Finest Hour, a factual series by Brian Lapping.<
Heartthrob Ioan Gruffudd stars in Warriors, a Bosnia drama directed (correct)
by Peter Kosminsky.<
Other drama scheduled for the Autumn includes costume drama Wives And
Daughters starring Bill Paterson, Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis and Pure
Wickedness, a Lucy Gannon drama about adultery starring Kevin Whately.<
Returning for new series will be Jonathan Creek, Casualty, Holby City,
Dangerfield and Ballykissangel.<
Walking With Dinosaurs is a ground-breaking recreation of prehistoric life,
using stunning computer animation.<
Prime Minister John Major's premiership will be summed up in The Major Years.<
This year's BBC Annual Report said BBC1 needed to make itself more distinct
from commercial channels.<
BBC bosses know it must prove it is different to justify the licence fee,
especially in the light of the Gavyn Davies report on the need for new BBC
funding to support digital services.<
Controller Peter Salmon said: ``BBC1 is at the heart of the BBC's public
service commitment _ now and in the digital future _ and this schedule is
tangible proof of that.<
``What this autumn on BBC1 represents is something the commercial sector can't
or won't produce.<
``There are no rights to be bought for a king's ransom.<
``It's not about poaching stars, it's not about imitating innovative formats.<
``It is about ambition, quality, commitment and talent.''<
