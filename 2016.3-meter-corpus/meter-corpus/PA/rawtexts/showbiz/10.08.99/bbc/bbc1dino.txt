FLAGSHIP SERIES BANKS ON DINOSAUR APPEAL<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Creatures who walked the Earth more than 65 million years ago are brought back
to life by state-of-the-art computer animation and advanced puppetry in new
television series Walking With Dinosaurs.<
Three years in the making, the stunning six part series is set to be the BBC's
landmark science programme later this year, just as The Human Body was last
year.<
``Put it this way, in all of Jurassic Park there were eight minutes of
dinosaur action footage. This is a whole series of it,'' BBC1 controller Peter
Salmon said today.<
``Dinosaurs ruled the earth for 170 million years, so that certainly puts our
millennium into perspective.''<
Thanks to informed scientific guesswork and advanced technology, favourites
like tyrannosaurus rex, diplodocus and stegosaurus will be seen in action,
hunting, feeding and breeding.<
The recreated dinosaurs are shot against backgrounds as close to the
prehistoric settings as can still be found, such as monkey puzzle forests in
Chile and New Zealand tree ferns.<
Less familiar beasts will be introduced to audiences, like the biggest ever
carnivore, liopleurodon and ornithocheirus, the largest flying creature.<
The film-makers went under water to create dramatic predator sequences
involving massive former inhabitants of the deep.<
Series producer Tim Haines said: ``Walking With Dinosaurs is the world's first
natural history of dinosaurs.<
``For the first time ever, people will have a window into a lost world to see
what it was really like when these extraordinary animals inhabited the Earth.<
``We'll show how these amazing creatures moved, how they lived and died, how
they hunted and fed, how they behaved and interacted with each other, how they
mated and brought up their young _ all set against authentic backgrounds.''<
Mr Salmon said: ``Not just children are going to love this series. I think
adults will enjoy it too.''<
A time and date for the series has yet to be announced.<
