TV BOSS DEFENDS UNDER-FIRE BBC1<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
BBC1 controller Peter Salmon defended his channel today in what he admitted
has been a difficult year.<
Growing commercial competition, consultation on the BBC licence fee review and
a ``could do better'' report from the BBC Governors have put BBC1 under
pressure.<
But launching his latest #195 million programme line-up, Mr Salmon said:
``This autumn's schedule will confound the Jeremiahs prophesying the imminent
demise of BBC1.''<
Spectacular science series Walking With Dinosaurs, new French and Saunders
sitcom Let Them Eat Cake and a trilogy of programmes about war throughout the
century are some of the highlights of the coming BBC1 season.<
Mr Salmon said today's launch was ``one of the most important in BBC1's
history''.<
He said: ``It comes in the teeth of fiercely aggressive and growing
competition, and at the end of a tough year before the dawn of a new millennium,
in the thick of licence fee consultation. So not much pressure there then. But I
am greatly proud of it.''<
He added: ``The end of broadcasting as we once knew it started some years ago,
and it would be disingenuous to say that this has been an easy year for BBC1.<
``We had to face some real problems, and most of them in the full glare of the
white hot media spotlight, but I think we have come out the stronger for it.''<
Former BBC1 controller Alan Yentob is presiding over a review of BBC1's
distinctiveness and public service purpose, after the BBC annual report said it
needed to make daytime schedules more distinctive and improve its comedy,
entertainment and popular drama genres.<
Mr Salmon said: ``What this autumn on BBC1 represents is something the
commercial sector can't or won't produce.<
``There are no rights to be bought for a king's ransom. It is not about
poaching stars. It is not about imitating innovative formats.<
``It's about ambition, quality, commitment and talent.''<
Mr Salmon said he worked at an ITV company before he joined the BBC.<
``I know the pressures that they are under; pressures that led to the
momentous and dubious decision to move News At Ten.<
``I am not attacking ITV. They must do what they must do. But I know what
makes us different.''<
BBC1 recently lost its sport figurehead Des Lynam to ITV, and a rash of
similar lifestyle and docusoap formats have appeared on each channel.<
The end of News At Ten made way for a new ITV evening schedule including
ratings-grabbing films and quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?<
At today's BBC1 schedule launch docusoaps took a back seat as Mr Salmon
focused on landmark drama, science and factual programming.<
Pride And Prejudice adapter Andrew Davies has turned his hand to Elizabeth
Gaskell's Wives And Daughters and Clive Owen is appearing in contemporary drama
Second Sight by Paula Milne.<
Undercover is a new investigative series being kept under wraps, because its
research team is still in the field.<
