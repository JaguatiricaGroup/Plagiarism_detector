RETURN OF ROVING STREET STARS<
By Harriet Tolputt, PA News<
Soap favourites Bet Gilroy and Reg Holdsworth are to return to British TV
screens in a Coronation Street special, it was announced today.<
Weatherfield's brassy barmaid Bet, played by Julie Goodyear, and lovable Reg,
played by Ken Morley, are to appear in a seaside special set in Brighton and
Calais.<
Chloe Newsome, who plays Vicky, the granddaughter of Bet's ex-husband Alec
(Roy Barraclough) will also make a comeback for the special.<
In the show, which will be screened this autumn in addition to the regular
four weekly episodes, street bad-boy Steve McDonald (Steve Gregson) and Vikram
Desai (Chris Bisson) head to Calais for an illegal tobacco run.<
But plans take an unexpected turn when they take a detour to deliver furniture
to Vicky's bar in Brighton.<
They find Vicky making plans for her wedding to Robert, played by Pride and
Prejudice actor Crispin Bonham-Carter _ but the arrival of ex-husband Steve
looks like it could jeopardise her ``big day''.<
Vicky's is not the only wedding which brings Bet back from Tenerife after her
departure in 1995.<
Vikram leaves Steve trying to win back his ex and heads off to France on his
own.<
There he teams up with sexy hitchhiker Gabrielle, played by Marie-Antoinette
Laquiere, and meets hypermarket manager Reg.<
A spokesman for the soap said: ``The episodes are still in the early stages.<
``It has not yet been confirmed how they will be screened or a date - but the
special is going to be exciting and good fun.<
``They are part of the run up to celebrating 40 years of the Street. We have
lots of things planned for the special anniversary next year.''<
