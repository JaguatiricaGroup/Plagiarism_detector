BARMAID BET RETURNS TO ROVERS<
By Sinead McIntyre, PA News<
Glamourous barmaid Bet Gilroy was back on familiar ground today as she began
rehearsals for her comeback in a Coronation Street special.<
Weatherfield's brassy blonde Bet, played by Julie Goodyear, and lovable Reg
Holdsworth, played by Ken Morley, will appear in a seaside special set in
Brighton and Calais.<
Today Bet was back outside her former home, the Rovers Return pub, wearing the
same gold earrings she had on four years ago when she packed her bags and left
the Street to start a new life abroad.<
As she posed for photographers, in a bright blue sequined dress, Julie said:
``Bet is back with bells on. The story is one of the best I have read and by
'eck the public are in for a treat.''<
She added: ``I'm so happy to be back on the Street, I feel like I have never
been away.''<
Chloe Newsome, who plays Vicky, the granddaughter of Bet's ex-husband Alec
(Roy Barraclough) will also make a comeback for the special.<
In the show, which will be screened this autumn in addition to the regular
four weekly episodes, street bad-boy Steve McDonald (Steve Gregson) and Vikram
Desai (Chris Bisson) head to Calais for an illegal tobacco run.<
But plans take an unexpected turn when they take a detour to deliver furniture
to Vicky's bar in Brighton.<
They find Vicky making plans for her wedding to Robert, played by Pride and
Prejudice actor Crispin Bonham-Carter. But the arrival of ex-husband Steve looks
like it could jeopardise her ``big day''.<
Vicky's is not the only wedding to bring Bet back from Tenerife.<
Vikram leaves Steve trying to win back his ex and heads to France on his own.<
There he teams up with sexy hitchhiker Gabrielle, played by Marie-Antoinette
Laquiere, and meets hypermarket manager Reg.<
A spokeswoman for the soap said Julie had been thrilled to be asked to do the
special.<
She said: ``Julie read the script and loved it, she couldn't wait to get back.
<
``The episodes are still in the early stages.'' The spokeswoman added: ``It
has not yet been confirmed how they will be screened or a date _ but the special
is going to be exciting and good fun.<
``They are part of the run-up to celebrating 40 years of the Street. We have
lots of things planned for the special anniversary next year.''<
