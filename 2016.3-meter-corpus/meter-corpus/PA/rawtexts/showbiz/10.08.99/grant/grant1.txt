GRANT HOPING FOR SECOND HIT OF THE SUMMER<
By Peter Walker, PA News<
Actor Hugh Grant will be hoping for his second hit film of the summer when he
attends the premiere of Mickey Blue Eyes tonight.<
Following the runaway success of Notting Hill, Grant will unveil his new work
in London's West End this evening alongside partner Elizabeth Hurley, who
produced the film.<
Others expected to attend include Grant's Notting Hill co-star Rhys Ifans,
Oasis singer Liam Gallagher and his wife Patsy Kensit, and actress Joan
Collins.<
Mickey Blue Eyes, which has received some favourable reviews in America, is a
light-hearted comedy about an Englishman in New York who accidentally becomes
involved with the Mafia.<
Yet again, Grant plays the wide-eyed and foppish English innocent, this time
an art auctioneer.<
His character is blissfully engaged to a teacher played by US star Jean
Tripplehorn, but there is a problem _ she is the daughter of a Mafia boss.<
The film charts Grant's escapades as he gets sucked inexorably into the Mob's
world and tries to stay afloat, not to mention alive.<
