HOW HOLLYWOOD TREATS THE MOB<
By Peter Walker, PA News<
The film world's favourite foppish Englishman, Hugh Grant, will be among the
stars at the premiere of his new Mafia-based comedy, Mickey Blue Eyes tonight.<
Grant plays a British auctioneer living in New York who becomes accidentally
embroiled with the Mob because his fiancee is from a Mafia family.<
The light-hearted treatment of Mafia family values is another demonstration of
how Hollywood's treatment of organised crime has changed over the decades:<
:: Most of the first gangster films, such as 1932's Scarface _ later re-made
starring Al Pacino _ treated organised crime as a violent menace to American
society.<
:: The seminal Mafia film is undoubtedly The Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola's
1972 masterpiece told the story of the Mob through the Corleone family's complex
and subtle relationships.<
:: The film and its two sequels were so influential that some real-life Mafia
families have been accused of actually cultivating the look and mannerisms
portrayed by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.<
:: Another Italian-American director, Martin Scorcese, showed the seamier side
of the Mafia world in 1990's enormously influential Goodfellas. His gangsters
existed in a jealous, violent and often treacherous world.<
:: Five years later Scorcese delved still deeper into the troubled personal
lives of the Mafiosi in Casino. <
:: Robert De Niro's Sam Rothstein was not only the hugely successful boss of a
crooked Las Vegas casino, but an anxious husband and father married to alcoholic
Sharon Stone, who eventually betrays him with best friend Joe Pesci.<
:: In 1997, Al Pacino shed the glamour of The Godfather's Michael Corleone to
play Donnie Brasco, a forty-something Mafia foot soldier whose ``work'' is often
little more than monotonous and seedy chores.<
:: In the film Pacino is befriended by undercover FBI agent Johnny Depp - and
spends much of his time complaining about the way his bosses treat him.<
:: Humorous television series The Sopranos, currently showing on Channel 4,
portrays the boss of a New Jersey crime family as a vulnerable, anxious man
seeking help from a psychiatrist.<
:: ``Waste management consultant'' Tony Soprano has normal family problems
such as a troublesome teenage daughter and a mean-spirited aged mother. To add
to his woes, he occasionally has to kill people.<
:: The theme is repeated in comedy film Analyse This, yet to be released in
Britain. Robert De Niro sends up some of his earlier gangster roles playing a
Mafia boss unloading his troubles to an understandably worried psychiatrist.<
