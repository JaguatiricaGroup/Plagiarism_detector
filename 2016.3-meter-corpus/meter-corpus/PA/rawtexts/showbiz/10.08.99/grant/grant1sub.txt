HURLEY'S DRESS DAZZLES PREMIERE CROWD<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Liz Hurley dazzled the crowd tonight in a daring dress covered with hundreds
of tiny mirrors as she accompanied boyfriend Hugh Grant to the premiere of his
new movie Mickey Blue Eyes.<
And the actress, who produced the film rather than starring in it, revealed
she actually manages to get ready for her glitzy appearances faster than her
long-term partner.<
Speaking at the screening in London's Leicester Square, the glamorous star
said: ``It doesn't take me long to get ready, but it takes Hugh ages.<
``He has a lot of shirts to choose from but they all look the same.''<
Hurley's dresses have been show stoppers at many of Grant's past premieres
including the opening of Four Weddings And A Funeral where she wore the Versace
safety-pin creation and the Notting Hill event at which she upstaged the star
Julia Roberts.<
Tonight she chose Versace again with a backless floor-length split dress made
of gold mesh which was sheer around the legs.<
On it was sewn a myriad of mirrors which jangled as she walked, as well as a
mosaic of tiny pink squares.<
She said of her passion for Versace: ``Donatella is a friend of mine and she
sends them to me from time to time. <
``I wear jeans 365 days a year and it's quite nice to get out of them
occasionally.''<
It is the first time that Hurley has produced one of her boyfriends movies and
Grant said it was a ``surprisingly good'' experience.<
But he added: ``We fight as you would with any girlfriend that's working with
you, like cats. But it's also quite soothing if you're a neurotic actor like I
am when there's someone who knows your foibles.''<
In the film he plays an English auctioneer who falls in love with a woman,
played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, whose father is tied up with the mafia. Gradually
Grant is drawn into the mob's world.<
He said tonight: ``I've always been obsessed with the mob. I've always wanted
to be in a mob film, and no one asked me, but now I am.''<
Tripplehorn was also at the event in a stunning outfit, this time with a black
floor-length sleeveless dress with a sheer top and only a dark band to spare her
blushes.<
Other guests at the screening included Oasis star Liam Gallagher and his
pregnant wife Patsy Kensit, for whose child Hurley is to be Godmother.<
