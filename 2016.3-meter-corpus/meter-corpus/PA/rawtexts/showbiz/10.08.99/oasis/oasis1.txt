OASIS STAR BONEHEAD QUITS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Oasis guitarist Paul ``Bonehead'' Arthurs has quit the hugely successful rock
band after eight years.<
The 34-year-old musician announced yesterday he was leaving the group in what
was said to be an amicable split.<
In a statement Arthurs said: ``After a lot of consideration I have decided to
call it a day with Oasis.<
``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever to come out
of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where I'd like to concentrate
on other things in my life, outside of the demands of being in a successful rock
and roll band.''<
The statement, released by the band's label Creation Records, continued:
``I've made some great friends along the way and wish everyone in the band every
success with the next album, and intend to enjoy watching the band go on to
further success in the coming years.<
``I would like to thank the band and everyone around it, especially the fans,
for making it so special. See you at the next show!''<
The band's spokesman said the departure had only been decided yesterday but
Arthurs had been considering it over the weekend.<
``It's been discussed between them all,'' he said.<
Arthurs was a founder member of the band, which was originally formed as Rain
in Burnage, Manchester, in 1991 with drummer Tony McCarroll and bass player Paul
``Guigsy'' McGuigan.<
A new singer, Liam Gallagher, suggested a change of name and the appointment
of his brother Noel, a former roadie with Oldham band Inspiral Carpets, gave the
group a new direction.<
Bonehead's rhythm guitar playing was an integral part of Oasis' powerful
sound, but he kept a lower public profile than lead guitarist and songwriter
Noel Gallagher.<
There are no plans for a replacement, the band's spokesman said.<
Arthurs, a father of two who lives with his wife Kate in Bowden, Cheshire, had
completed work on the band's fourth studio album, which is still being mixed.<
His departure means that only McGuigan remains from the original line-up.<
McCarroll was sacked in 1995 and awarded a lump sum of #550,000 earlier this
year in an out of court settlement instead of royalties.<
