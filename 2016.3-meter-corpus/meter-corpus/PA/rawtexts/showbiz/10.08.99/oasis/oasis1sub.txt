OASIS LEADER PLAYS DOWN GUITARIST'S DEPARTURE<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Oasis star Noel Gallagher has played down the significance of guitarist Paul
``Bonehead'' Arthurs' departure by saying: ``It's hardly Paul McCartney leaving
The Beatles.''<
Speaking to music paper New Musical Express he confirmed that Arthurs had
quit, but said it happened as far back as March _ not over the weekend as the
band's publicist said.<
Band leader Gallagher said: ``Yeah, he's gone. He left in March. He wanted to
spend more time with his family.<
``He has two kids up in Manchester and he wanted to be with them so we let him
go.<
``It's hardly Paul McCartney leaving The Beatles. It happens, things happen.
He did his thing for the record but that's that _ so we have to find another
guitarist now.''<
Yesterday, the group's spokesman said Arthurs, 34, would not be replaced.<
A journalist from NME spoke to the band at London's Olympic Studios, where
they are working with producer Mark ``Spike'' Stent on mixes for the new album
due out next year.<
``We're not touring until next year so there's no rush to find a guitarist
just yet,'' Gallagher added.<
Yesterday, Arthurs _ who was in an early incarnation of the band before both
singer Liam Gallagher and lead guitarist and songwriter Noel _ issued a
statement through his label Creation Records.<
It read: ``After a lot of consideration I have decided to call it a day with
Oasis.<
``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever to come out
of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where I'd like to concentrate
on other things in my life, outside of the demands of being in a successful rock
and roll band.''<
``I've made some great friends along the way and wish everyone in the band
every success with the next album, and intend to enjoy watching the band go on
to further success in the coming years.<
Despite Gallagher's assertion that the rhythm guitarist left in March, he was
reported to have been seen in April at the French chateau in which the band were
recording.<
He did return to the UK before the rest of the band, according to the latest
edition of NME, which is published nationally tomorrow.<
