ROW OVER BLACKADDER MILLENNIUM SPECIAL<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
TV's Blackadder was at the centre of a row today as rival broadcasters
disagreed about their cunning plans to screen a one-off millennium special of
the historical sitcom.<
Sky Television claimed a coup by announcing it would be the first to screen
the star-studded Rowan Atkinson film, Time For Blackadder, on TV.<
Yet although the BBC concedes it might have missed out on being first, it
brushed aside Sky claims that the Corporation will not screen it at all.<
The 30-minute film has been produced to be shown as part of millennium
celebrations and will be shown exclusively at the Dome's entertainment venue
Skyscape _ which is sponsored by Sky.<
It stars Atkinson, Tony Robinson and other well established stars of the four
Blackadder series aired first on the BBC. Indeed, the film's executive producer
is the BBC's head of comedy, Geoffrey Perkins.<
The film _ featuring Blackadder and Baldrick hurtling through history in a
time machine _ is then to be screened on TV in 2001.<
Sky said today that it had won the ``exclusive'' rights to the special, while
the BBC claimed to know nothing of a deal.<
But Dome supervisor the New Millennium Experience Company was unable to say
who would show it first.<
A NMEC spokesman said: ``We are currently in discussions with both Sky and the
BBC as to the broadcasting of the film after the exhibition closes.''<
However a Sky publicist said: ``We have a deal. We have agreed terms. The BBC
are obviously having trouble coming to terms with their loss.''<
A BBC spokeswoman said it was probably the case that Sky might be first to
broadcast the special, but said: ``There is absolutely no question of this not
being shown on the BBC.<
``It is certainly not the case that we have lost Blackadder. This is a
one-off, stand-alone film which we agreed would be shown at a national monument
and would then be on the BBC.<
``The stars agreed to do it on the basis that it would be on BBC1.''<
