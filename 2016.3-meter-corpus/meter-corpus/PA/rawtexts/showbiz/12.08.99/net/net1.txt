TOP STARS LINED UP FOR INTERNET CONCERTS<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
George Michael, Robbie Williams, Celine Dion and The Corrs are among top pop
acts set to highlight world poverty at concerts to be linked by a massive
Internet broadcast in October.<
They are among the first artists named for the three linked concerts in
London, New York and Geneva which organisers hope will inspire music fans as
much as the Live Aid concerts for Ethiopia 15 years ago.<
``The concerts will be one of the most widely broadcast programmes for social
change in history,'' a spokesman said today.<
As well as being broadcast from one of the world's most powerful web sites,
NetAid on October 9 will be shown by the BBC in Britain and other television
channels around the world.<
The concert is being organised by the United Nations Development Programme and
leading Internet company Cisco Systems.<
Proceeds from the three concerts will go to help Kosovo refugees and African
countries, and a NetAid Foundation is being set up to channel funds long-term.<
Other artists already signed up are Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend, Counting
Crows, Eurythmics, Jewel, Wyclef Jean, Bono and Michael Kamen and Orchestra.<
