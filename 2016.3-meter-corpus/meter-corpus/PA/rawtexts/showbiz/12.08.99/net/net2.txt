The only way to see the concerts live will be at the NetAid site - the
television broadcasts will be highlights shown no earlier than the next day.<
A distribution network of more than 1,500 servers worldwide is being set up
which will be able to handle 125,000 live streams, 10 times more than any
previous single site.<
KPMG, Akamai Technologies and Real Networks are playing their part in setting
up the site and broadcast.<
Net surfers will be able to donate money through the site, but organisers'
main intention is to highlight extreme poverty and bring concerned people
together to fight it.<
It will eventually be linked to the sites of dozens of non-governmental
organisations tackling world poverty.<
UNDP administrator Mark Malloch Brown said: ``An estimated 1.3 billion people
in the world live on less than a dollar a day.<
``The gulf between the world's rich and poor is growing.<
``But a group of very reasonable policy makers have concluded that it is a
reasonable target to set that by the end of 2010 we can halve the number of
people living in absolute poverty.''<
On advice from the UNDP, NetAid will focus on five pillars - Third World debt,
hunger, refugees, human rights and the environment as it affects people.<
Promoter Harvey Goldsmith said: ``It is a fantastic line-up of artists and all
of them are committed to our cause of eradicating extreme poverty.<
``Bono has done a huge amount on fighting Third World debt, Eurythmics have
been very active over human rights, Robbie Williams is a United Nations
ambassador on children's issues and George Michael is concerned about
refugees.''<
To be launched on September 8, www.netaid.org will be a permanent site
dedicated to highlighting extreme poverty, and organisers hope it will register
one billion hits.<
About 55 million people use the Internet regularly, and organisers believe it
is an achievable target over time.<
Mr Goldsmith, one of Live Aid's organisers in 1985, said: ``The original
target was #1 million, and the night before Bob Geldof spoke to me and we
thought we might raise #5 million.<
``We actually raised #140 million. That was how much we moved people with Live
Aid and I think we can move people again with NetAid,'' he said.<
``There will be a backstage area were artists will be able to talk online with
people, and once they hear their passion I think people will want to help as
well.''<
The full Wembley line-up will be announced on Monday August 23, and tickets go
on sale the day after.<
A total of 110,000 tickets will be available for that concert and the one at
the Giants Stadium in New Jersey which will follow.<
The Geneva event will be shorter and by invitation only.<
Cisco Systems UK managing director Chris Dedicoat said he realised the
Internet revolution was leaving most of the world's poorest people behind.<
``The potential of NetAid is to harness the resources of the Internet to help
impoverished people to set up an infrastructure so that it is easier for the
developed world to help,'' he said.<
