RAVI SET TO LEAVE THE STREET<
By Sinead McIntyre, PA News<
Shopkeeper Ravi Desai is to be written out of Coronation Street.<
Actor Saeed Jaffrey was brought in to reflect the reality of multi-cultural
Britain, but he will now be written out, and Coronation Street bosses are
currently casting for a new male Desai family member to play the part of a
cousin.<
A spokeswoman for the show said the decision was nothing to do with the
actor's arrest last month after an incident on a Euston to Manchester train.<
She said: ``It is nothing to do with that incident on the train. The decision
was taken before that. I think people are reading things into this that aren't
there.''<
``People are written out, and it is not necessarily for ever. The Desai family
are an important part of the Street and we are casting for a new member.''<
The spokeswoman said that Ravi would be written out in a definite way.<
She said: ``He will leave Weatherfield for a reason, although we can't divulge
why. He won't just go up the stairs and never come down again, but be talked
about as if he is still there.''<
``And he won't be leaving any broken hearts behind'', she added.<
