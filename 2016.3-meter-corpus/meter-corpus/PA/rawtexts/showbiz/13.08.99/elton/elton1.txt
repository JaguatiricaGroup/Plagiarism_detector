MY EX-MANAGER DOES NOT EXIST _ SIR ELTON<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Sir Elton John feels ``partly to blame'' for the rift with his long-standing
manager John Reid, but thinks he will never speak to him again, he has said.<
``As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist any more, which is very sad, but
he doesn't,'' he told Sir David Frost in a wide-ranging interview to be shown in
America this weekend.<
Sir Elton dispensed with Reid's management services last year after a business
relationship of 28 years, and Reid has reportedly paid the star a multi-million
settlement out of court.<
Legal discussion continues over more allegedly missing millions with Andrew
Haydon, former managing director of John Reid Enterprises and accountants Price
Waterhouse Coopers.<
John Reid was Sir Elton's first boyfriend in the singer-songwriter's early
years of success in the 1970s.<
In the Frost interview, to be screened on American cable channel A&E on Sunday
night, Sir Elton said: ``I was partly to blame for this whole thing I suppose,
with John Reid, because I never audited it in 28 years, and when I did it was a
shock.<
``He was my first relationship and there was that element of trust, which is
so necessary to have.''<
``Saddened'' John Reid has said Sir Elton's claims ``have no foundation in
fact.''<
Sir Elton also spoke of his problems following the takeover of his worldwide
record company Polygram by Universal.<
``It's an absolute disaster.  I think when one company buys another, for the
first two years it's more or less chaos and mayhem,'' he said.<
One To One With David Frost: Elton John: My Gift Is My Song was recorded in
Britain before Sir Elton's heart health scare and pacemaker operation.<
His rescheduled British concerts are now taking place next month.<
Sir Elton, 52, talked candidly about his former drug problems.<
``Clinically, I should be dead,'' he said, but added: ``I have the
constitution of an ox.''<
His notorious throat problems midway through an Australian tour in the
mid-1980s were caused by marijuana, he revealed.<
``I couldn't really talk, I could just about sing,'' he said.<
``I went to a specialist in Sydney and I walked in and said: `Good morning.'<
``The first thing he said was: `You smoke marijuana.'  I was so shocked.<
``And he said: `I can tell you that's not good for your voice.'''<
Sir Elton was terrified he had cancer: ``That big word, you know, the
six-letter one that fills you with fear.''<
Once the tour was over he had two benign growths removed from his throat and
he never smoked marijuana again, although he was still taking drugs including
cocaine.<
``I didn't give up the hokey-cokey, as they say, but the marijuana went
straight out of the window,'' he said.<
Drug-free since 1990, Sir Elton revealed he cleaned up in hospital: ``Because
I have my doubts about some of these rehab centres.<
``I just think some of these places now are not strict enough.''<
Treatment only lasts four weeks and clients have televisions in their rooms,
but he had to clean up after himself and do his own washing, he said.<
Sir Elton hit out at the ``wailing and caterwauling'' from Madonna and other
celebrities about press intrusion after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.<
``They've manipulated the press to suit their own ends.<
``What they go through and what I go through is nothing to what she went
through.''<
