PLAQUE MARKS CENTENARY OF MASTER OF TERROR'S BIRTH<
By Rebecca Allison, PA News<
The daughter of the undisputed master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, was today
marking the centenary of his birth at a special ceremony.<
Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell was to revisit the London flat, home to her
famous father and mother for more than a decade, and unveil a commemorative
plaque.<
The English Heritage blue plaque marking his birthday, which aptly fell on
Friday 13, honoured his unique contribution to the world of cinema.<
The director and his wife Alma Reville lived in the upstairs flat on the
Cromwell Road for 13 years during his early career as he was making a name for
himself at the Islington Studios.<
The couple, and their 10-year-old daughter later moved to the US in 1939,
where his career took off and he became one of the biggest film legends in
Hollywood.<
His thrillers, including Psycho and The Birds, have inspired terror in
generations of filmgoers and are regarded as classics worldwide.<
During his long career he directed an illustrious list of screen greats which
included Cary Grant in North By North West, and James Stewart and Grace Kelly in
Rear Window.<
Hitchcock, born on August 13, 1899, to a Catholic family in Leytonstone, was
well known for his cameo appearances in his films.<
Fans would eagerly await the fleeting moment when he would appear in the
background in some form, often as an inconspicuous passer-by.<
Patricia too made appearances in her father's films, including Stagefright and
Psycho, which was recently voted his best film by a distinguished panel of
directors.<
Today she also was also to make an appearance in advance of a special auction
of posters at Christie's in London as part of the centenary celebrations for her
father, who died in 1980.<
More than 100 film posters spanning his illustrious career will go under the
hammer on Monday September 13.<
