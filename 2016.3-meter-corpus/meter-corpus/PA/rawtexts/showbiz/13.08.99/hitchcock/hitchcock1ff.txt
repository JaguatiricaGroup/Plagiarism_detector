LIFE AND TIMES OF ALFRED HITCHCOCK<
By Rebecca Allison, PA News<
The daughter of the undisputed master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, wastoday
marking the centenary of his birth at a special ceremony.<
:: Hitchcock began his career in advertising. He entered the film industry in
1920, designing subtitles and his talent was spotted.<
:: He met his wife Alma Reville when he was an engineering student at London
University and she was a film editor at the fledgling Paramount studios. The
couple, who were married for 54 years had a daughter, Patricia.<
:: He was a close friend and confidant of many of Hollywood's most glamorous
women including Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak.<
:: The director, who died in 1980, has in the past been accused of exploiting
his stars by manipulating their emotions and was once quoted as calling actors
``cattle''.<
:: A famous example of his alleged insensitivity towards stars involved Tippi
Hedren in The Birds when, legend has it, she did not know so many real birds
would be used and was traumatised for months afterwards by the terrifying
scene.<
:: Filming the famous shower scene in the 1960 film Psycho took seven working
days and more than 70 takes for just 45 seconds of film.<
:: Janet Leigh, who played the murder victim Marion Crane recently said she
had never got over the shock of seeing Psycho for the first time and has never
taken a shower again.<
:: Hitchcock bought the rights to the novel on which the film was based
anonymously from Robert Bloch for 9,000. He then bought as many copies as he
could, to keep the ending a secret.<
:: Sharp-eyed fans would look forward to his renowned cameo appearances in the
background of nearly all his films, for example his role as clockwinder in Rear
Window, and numerous appearances as a passer-by.<
:: The British Film Institute is holding a programme of Hitchcock centenary
events.<
