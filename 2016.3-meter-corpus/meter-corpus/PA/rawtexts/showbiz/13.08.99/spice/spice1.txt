MEL C CHOOSES CLUB FOR FIRST SOLO APPEARANCE<
By Mark Wilkinson, PA News<
Spice Girl Mel C has chosen a small club to play her first ever solo concert,
it was disclosed today.<
Sporty Spice has chosen The Leadmill, Sheffield, which has a capacity of just
900, for her debut gig on Thursday.<
A spokesman for the club said: ``It should be a really exciting night. We're
expecting a full house and we're delighted she has chosen us for her first
concert.''<
Mel C last appeared in Sheffield in September 1998, when the Spice Girls
played two 40,000 sell-out shows at the Don Valley Stadium.<
``The crowd is obviously going to be a lot smaller, but we're hoping for a
good atmosphere,'' said the spokesman.<
``She chose us because she wanted a nice intimate venue with a bit of history
before she appears at the V99 Festival.''<
The club has played host to Oasis, Pulp and Paul Weller in the past, but more
recent artists have included the likes of Sneaker Pimps and reggae artist
Mishka.<
``The other Mel has gone off and done solo stuff, now it is my turn to have a
bit of a scream and shout,'' said Mel. ``The band and the set I am doing is very
appropriate for the venue.''<
Mel plays her first big solo concerts at the V99 Festivals in Chelmsford and
Staffordshire on August 21 and 22, prior to the release of her debut solo
single, called Goin' Down, on September 27.<
