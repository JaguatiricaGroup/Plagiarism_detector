DRINK-DRIVING BAN COSTS COOGAN `DREAM JOB'<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Top Gear presenter Brendan Coogan has lost his dream job because of a
drink-drive conviction, it emerged today.<
Coogan, 28, pleaded guilty on Monday to driving with excess alcohol in his
blood. He had been stopped by police the morning after a drinking session.<
Coogan, the brother of comedian Steve, said he hoped his misfortune would
highlight the perils of getting behind the wheel the day after drinking.<
He said: ``I would urge anyone who knows that they have to drive the next day
to think very carefully about how much they drink the previous evening.<
``I would consider myself very unlucky. I have lost my dream job because of
this mistake.''<
Brendan was one of the new presenters who joined BBC2 motoring programme Top
Gear after the departure of Jeremy Clarkson.<
He pleaded guilty to drink-driving at Huddersfield Magistrates Court on
Monday.<
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``He has received a ban of 12 months and a fine of
#500.<
``Brendan was not alert to the dangers of the morning after drinking, and is
absolutely horrified that this has happened.<
``He's keen to use this opportunity of his profile to make members of the
public aware of them.''<
Coogan added: ``I am quite philosophical. I would never knowingly drink and
drive - I think drinking and driving is morally reprehensible and here I am
convicted of the very same. I find it very embarrassing.''<
The offence happened after he spent an evening drinking with his girlfriend
and other friends.<
He got a taxi home, slept from 1.30am to 11am and then drove off in his car to
see his team Manchester United play Middlesbrough.<
``On his way he was stopped by West Yorkshire Police and breathalysed, and he
was subsequently charged on Monday June 14,'' the BBC spokeswoman said.<
A blood test confirmed he was slightly over the limit, she said.<
Coogan once crashed his brother's Ferrari, but he declared himself in favour
of careful and polite driving.<
The BBC spokeswoman said: ``Brendan was an ad hoc contributor employed on a
programme-by-programme basis for BBC2's Top Gear.''<
The loss of his driving licence meant he would not be taken back on for the
next series which returns in the autumn, she said.<
``Top Gear will review this situation once the ban has been lifted.''<
