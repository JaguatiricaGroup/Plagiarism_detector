Coogan said today that he believed his record would bar him from ever working
for a motoring show again.<
``I resigned. I walked away because I did not want to embarrass them. It's
unlikely I will ever apply to Top Gear again because of the conviction.<
``Gutted is an often-used phrase, but it does not do justice to how I feel.<
``I am devastated. I am a reasonably young lad in a profession that is quite
precarious, and I had landed my dream job. I am nuts about cars and there I was
contributing to Top Gear,'' he said.<
``To have that all taken away from me for what was a stupid mistake _ I was
really down and upset about it, but I am starting to come to terms with it now.<
``I'm not asking people to feel sorry for me because plenty of other people
have lost their jobs in the same position.<
``I still have other television and radio presenting jobs, but Top Gear is a
programme everybody knows and likes.<
``It was my top gig.''<
He added: ``Yes, I had been out with friends, but it was not an especially big
night.<
``If I had thought for a second that I was over the limit, I would never have
got behind the wheel.<
``My driving was impaired, and I have to acknowledge that.<
``I would like to warn people of the dangers, because it is astonishing just
how long after the night before you can be over the limit.''<
