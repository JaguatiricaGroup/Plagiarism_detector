COMPO TO HAVE POIGNANT `SUMMER WINE' SEND-OFF<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
A poignant demise for Compo is to be written into new scripts for Last Of The
Summer Wine, the BBC confirmed today, following the death of actor Bill Owen,
who played the much-loved character for 26 years.<
The coming series was midway through filming when Mr Owen died, aged 85,
earlier this week.<
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``It is early days, but I think that the general
feeling is that Compo was such an important and integral character that it is
inevitable he could not be written out in any other way.''<
Preparing to re-write the remaining episodes, writer Roy Clarke said the
poignant death of the pensioner would be written into the new scripts.<
``There is no way we can pretend that Compo has just gone away: that would be
an insult to the man and his fans,'' he told the Daily Express.<
``I believe we must portray his death in the script. It may prove too
difficult for his family, but it would be a tribute to the actor and his
audience to make an honest attempt to give Compo a decent burial.''<
Before his final illness, Bill Owen revealed that he planned to be laid to
rest in Holmfirth, the Yorkshire setting of the series which is the
longest-running sitcom on British television.<
In scenes already filmed Compo finally wins a kiss from the fearsome Nora
Batty after 26 years of tireless pursuit.<
Kathy Staff, who plays the battle-axe with the wrinkly stockings, said Mr Owen
asked producers to grant Compo's lifetime wish knowing he was ill.<
A BBC entertainment spokeswoman said it was far too early to decide whether Mr
Owen's death would end Last Of The Summer Wine for good.<
``I don't think anybody is able to say at this stage,'' she said.<
