SUMMER WINE `CAN GO ON WITHOUT COMPO'<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Last Of The Summer Wine star Peter Sallis said the long-running show should
live on, despite the death this week of well-loved actor Bill Owen, who played
loveable scruff Compo.<
Sallis, who plays Clegg, disagreed with co-star Kathy Staff, who suggested the
series should fold without Compo, who constantly fought for the affections of
her character, Nora Batty, in the show.<
Owen himself - who died on Monday after a cancer battle - would have wanted
the gentle comedy to continue, Sallis told London station LBC 1152AM.<
``I think that Kathy is wrong. I do agree with her that Bill is irreplaceable
and that not having him there, it's not going to seem the same,'' he said.<
``But I have an idea that there is sufficient to watch in that programme with
the others.<
``It's a very, very strong team and although one part of me agrees with Kathy,
the other part says I think (writer) Roy Clarke and the BBC have, if they want
to continue with it, the means to do so.<
``I don't think for a moment Bill would have thought `Oh well, I've gone so we
better close the programme'. Really, basically, he would have wished it to go
on.''<
Clarke has already indicated that he will be writing Compo's death into the
scripts, which are now being revised. Three episodes of a new series have
already been filmed with Owen.<
In those last scenes Compo finally wins a kiss from Nora Batty after 26 years
of tireless pursuit.<
Owen had asked producers to grant Compo's lifetime wish knowing he was ill.<
A BBC entertainment spokeswoman said today that it was far too early to decide
whether Mr Owen's death would end Last Of The Summer Wine for good.<
``I don't think anybody is able to say at this stage,'' she said.<
