CHARLES JOINS STARS GALORE TO SEE PHANTOM MENACE<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The Prince of Wales joins a galaxy of stars tonight when he becomes one of the
first people in the UK to see the eagerly-awaited Star Wars prequel at the Royal
Premiere in London.<
Just hours later, hundreds of thousands of fans will besiege screens as
Episode I - The Phantom Menace opens at upwards of 370 cinemas around the UK and
Ireland.<
Charles will meet actors like Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson, as well as
director George Lucas when the film blasts off at the Odeon in Leicester
Square.<
Having already taken a colossal 385 million dollars (#240 million) in eight
weeks of release in the US alone, the film is on target to become the biggest
grossing film of all time.<
It takes cinemagoers back 30 years from the original blockbuster to show the
early years of Anakin Skywalker _ who went on to terrorise the universe as Darth
Vader in the trio of Star Wars movies which are already familiar to fans.<
Thousands are expected to gather in Leicester Square to watch guests troop
into the cinema, which also hosted the premiere of the first Star Wars two
decades ago.<
The movie's stars _ including Natalie Portman (Princess Amidala) and Anthony
Daniels (C-3PO) _ will be led on foot past the cheering crowds.<
Charles is not expected to take his sons Prince William and Harry to the
event, which will raise money for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.<
The film opens to the general public tomorrow. Eager fans swamped phone
booking lines and queued throughout the night to get their hands on tickets when
they went on sale earlier this month.<
Many cinema chains had hoped to open in the early hours to show the film, but
were unable to get clearance. Instead many will be opening from 9am and will be
showing the film back-to-back.<
Some have devoted three or four screens to the film to allow a rolling
programme of The Phantom Menace, with the movie starting every hour.<
Critics have not been universally won over by the special effects-laden film,
but the occasional poor review has not dimmed the loyalty and curiosity of fans
who have poured in to see it in the US.<
Huge interest in the space saga was demonstrated this week when the first Star
Wars was named the best movie of all time in a poll for the Sky Premier
channel.<
