SPACE EPIC FANS FLOCK TO SEE THE STARS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Fans were out in force tonight and fighting their own space battles as they
jostled outside the Royal Premiere of the eagerly-awaited movie Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.<
A crowd of thousands stood outside the Odeon Leicester Square hoping to catch
a glimpse of the movie stars as they turned up for the screening, being attended
by the Prince of Wales.<
The London cinema, which also hosted the premiere of the original Star Wars,
was decorated with an enormous picture of new arch-villain Darth Maul.<
Fans were 10-deep in specially-built crowd cages and roared for the early
arrivals.<
They included veterans of the first three films in the saga, Peter Mayhew -
who played Chewbacca - and diminutive Kenny Baker, R2-D2.<
Baker, who also appears in the new film - which has taken 385 million dollars
(#240 million) in the US so far, told of the heat generated in his metal shell.<
``It was incredibly hot in my costume. At one point they tried to fry an egg
on the outside,'' he said.<
