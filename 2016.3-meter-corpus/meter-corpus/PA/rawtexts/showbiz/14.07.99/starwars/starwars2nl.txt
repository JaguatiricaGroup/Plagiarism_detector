Brian Blessed, who plays Boss Nass, said the film appealed to the child in him.<
``I've never grown up. I just grew down,'' he said.<
``To be here and see it and to see the whole thing is great. I've only seen my
bit so far.''<
He described being cast in the film as ``a dream come true''.<
``I believe I have the last line in the film _ that's great. At last, success
at 62.''<
Ahmed Best, who plays Jar Jar Binks, said he had no problems portraying his
hyperactive character. ``Oh, I dug deep,'' he joked. ``I'm naturally a very
energetic kind of person.<
``This is the sixth time I've seen it. I've been to five others but I think
it's great every time.''<
The film has been criticised in some parts for racial stereotyping in some of
the characters, including his own.<
But he hit back, saying: ``If you see racism in an animated,
computer-generated character then you have a problem.''<
Writer and director George Lucas, who personally financed the blockbuster, was
also at tonight's screening.<
He said: ``It's great to be here because most of the crew are here and
everyone else who helped to make it.''<
He brushed off some of the poor reviews of the film, saying: ``None of my
films have been received well. People forget these films are aimed at children
not at adults.''<
Actress Natalie Portman received some of the biggest cheers of the night on
her arrival, wearing a strapless duck egg blue bodice and a chiffon skirt of the
same shade and her hair plaited and tucked up at the back.<
She said: ``It's fantastic being here because we never get that much attention
in the United States because there are so many films.<
``It was really exciting making the film. It was a big action film and it was
exciting to do but you had to imagine a lot, standing in front of a blue
screen.''<
However, the biggest roar from the crowd came when Samuel L Jackson walked
along the boulevard in front of the cinema, wearing a white dinner jacket and
his trademark Kangol hat pulled round the wrong way.<
Jackson, who plays Jedi knight Mace Windu, said: ``The best memory I have was
showing up on the first day and putting on my Jedi outfit knowing it was
mine.''<
Ewan McGregor, who plays young Obi-Wan Kenobi, had to be hurried into the
cinema because of the arrival of the Prince of Wales at the premiere but managed
to say: ``It was great being a Jedi _ real Boys Own stuff.''<
Among the guests were Film 99 host Jonathan Ross with his wife Jane Goldman,
who was wearing a red dress with lace sleeves, Ronan Keating and his wife
Yvonne, and actresses Angela Griffin and Lisa Faulkner from BBC1's Holby City.<
