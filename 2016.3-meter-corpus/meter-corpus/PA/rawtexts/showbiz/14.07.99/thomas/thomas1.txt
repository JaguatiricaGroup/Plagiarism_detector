FONDA AND BALDWIN ON TRACK FOR THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE FILM<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Easy Rider star Peter Fonda and movie heart-throb Alec Baldwin are on track to
star in a big screen version of Thomas The Tank Engine, it was announced today.<
Thomas & The Magic Railroad will mix many of the traditional characters
created by the Rev Wilbert Awdry with elements introduced by the film's director
Britt Allcroft, who created the animated TV series.<
Shot in the Isle Of Man, Canada and the United States, it will feature live
action footage and model animation, and is expected to released next summer.<
Baldwin, who is already well-known to Thomas fans in the US where he narrates
the series, will play the role of the magical Mr Conductor.<
And Fonda, who was Oscar nominated for Ulee's Gold, will play the new
character of Grandpa Burnett Stone, who has a central role in the story.<
In the movie his 11-year-old screen granddaughter Lily, played by Mara Wilson
from Matilda and Mrs Doubtfire, sets off to find him but gets on the wrong train
and is plunged into a battle of good against evil.<
It is set in the fantasy world of Mr Conductor's Universe with the island of
Sodor - where the talking trains live - at one end and Shining Time, nestled
deep in the heart of Indian Valley, at the other. They are connected by the
magic railroad.<
The rest of the cast, including Thomas and the rest of the trains, have not
yet been cast. The Fat Controller, Sir Topham Hat, is expected to be seen in
just an animated form.<
Many of the characters will inevitably have American accents.<
Allcroft, who is also the producer and writer of the film, was chuffed with
the casting.<
``I am delighted that Alec, Peter and Mara will bring these special characters
to life in our first Thomas feature film.<
``Having had the pleasure of working with Alec before I am excited at what he
will bring to the prime role of Mr Conductor. Regarding Peter he is a fine actor
and it is wonderful that he has decided to bring one of the central characters
to the screen.<
``As for Mara I know she is going to bring tremendous intelligence and insight
to the role of Lily.<
Production begins in the Isle Of Man next month, moving later to Toronto and
Pennsylvania.<
The late Rev Awdry first published his characters in 1945 after inventing them
to amuse his son Christopher who had measles. Christopher later took over the
authorship.<
The film has been in the sidings since 1996 when the project was first
announced. Allcroft, who already had the licence to make the TV shows, signed a
deal for rights to the name last year.<
