WESTLIFE EDGE AHEAD IN RACE FOR CHRISTMAS NO 1<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Irish band Westlife has nudged ahead in the race for the Christmas chart
number one - and could topple Sir Cliff Richard this weekend.<
The group were around 3,000 sales ahead of Sir Cliff's The Millennium Prayer -
which has clung to the position for three weeks - at close of tills yesterday.<
Westlife became the first boy band to go straight to the top of the charts
with their first three singles this year.<
If their double A-side single of cover versions I Have A Dream/Seasons In The
Sun stays at the top of the chart by Sunday they will become only the second act
ever to go to number one with their first four singles in the week they were
released.<
The only other group to do so were fellow Irish stars B*Witched.<
John Lennon's enduring classic Imagine is at number three, according to the
early sales figures, 4,000 copies behind Sir Cliff.<
The single, which topped the charts shortly after he died 19 years ago this
week, was re-released due to public demand.<
Sir Cliff has the advantage of an extra day's sales built into his total
compared to his rivals as his Sunday sales count towards next week's chart.
Lennon and Westlife both had their singles released on Monday.<
The much-hyped novelty single by The Cuban Boys, featuring yodelling hamsters
from a popular web site, is in fourth place with around 20,000 sales.<
Chart expert Jason Legg of HMV said: ``It is really too close to call at this
stage. Westlife are only 3,000 ahead after selling around 40,000 copies but
anything could happen.<
``They have a strong fan base who tend to buy their records on the first day,
but they are a pop act which tends to sell well at the weekend as well.<
``Imagine is the sort of record that we would probably see selling well all
week. It could go anyway but my money would be on Westlife.''<
An all-star charity cover version of the Rolling Stones' It's Only Rock 'n'
Roll is way down at number 18 according to first day sales.<
It features the Spice Girls, who have topped the charts for the past three
Christmases, but were too busy to record a single in their own right this year.<
If Sir Cliff does hang on at the top of the charts this weekend it will be his
third Christmas number one.<
His others were Mistletoe And Wine and Saviour's Day.<
