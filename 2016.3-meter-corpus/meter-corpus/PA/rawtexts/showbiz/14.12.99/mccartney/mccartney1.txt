GLOBAL AUDIENCE FOR McCARTNEY'S CAVERN GIG<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Sir Paul McCartney tonight rounds off the century by playing his smallest show
for three decades, at the intimate venue which helped to propel him to stardom.<
For the first time in 36 years he will plug in his bass and perform at
Liverpool's Cavern Club where he and The Beatles set out on the path to becoming
legends.<
Although an audience of just 300 will be inside the rebuilt club, millions
around the globe will see and hear it via a webcast, TV screenings and radio
broadcasts.<
He said: ``Before The Beatles ever got big we started out playing rock'n'roll
at The Cavern.<
``I'm going back as a nod to the music that has always _ and will ever _
thrill me. I can't think of a better way to rock out the end of the century.''<
The star will be performing with the band which featured on his recent album
Run Devil Run including Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour, Deep Purple's Ian Paice and
Mick Green of The Pirates. A few ``surprises'' are also planned.<
The Beatles performed regularly at The Cavern before they won their first
recording deal and continued to perform there until Beatlemania began to take
hold.<
Director of The Cavern, Bill Heckle, said: ``Rock 'n'roll history will be made
tonight in Liverpool. It will be loud, hot and sweaty _ just the way rock'n'roll
should be.<
``In size, the show is tiny _ but its mark will be made all around the
planet.''<
Music fans from around the world have tried to get hold of tickets for the
show but just 75 pairs were available and handed out through a raffle.<
Application forms were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis at HMV
stores and names of the lucky winners were drawn from a hat on Friday.<
TV and newspaper reporters are flying in from 20 countries to attend the
concert.<
