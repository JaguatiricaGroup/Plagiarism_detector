McCARTNEY RETURNS TO THE BEATLES' SECOND HOME<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Music legend Sir Paul McCartney was returning to his roots tonight by playing
the underground venue at which The Beatles honed their skills and became almost
their second home.<
He is to play a one-off show at The Cavern Club in Liverpool for a handful of
fans.<
:: Sir Paul first played The Cavern on January 24, 1958 with The Quarrymen,
the skiffle band he saw at a Liverpool church fete and later joined after
impressing the singer, John Lennon, with his knowledge of song lyrics.<
:: He had missed the band's first Cavern show five months earlier. Instead, he
was at a scout camp in Hathersage, Derbyshire.<
:: Evolving into The Beatles, the group first played the venue under that name
at a lunchtime show on February 9, 1961. The fee was just #5 and Pete Best was
still the drummer, later replaced by Ringo Starr.<
:: Brian Epstein, the manager whose persistence led to a major record deal,
first came across the band at The Cavern. Folklore says he was alerted after an
inquiry in his record shop about one of their German recordings.<
:: His final Beatles show at The Cavern was on August 3, 1963, the group's
274th show there in two and a half years.<
:: Since then McCartney has performed 587 live concerts _ with The Beatles
(252), Wings (142) and as an artist in his own right (193).<
:: Sir Paul's performance tonight comes 12,953 days since he last performed
there.<
:: The Cavern opened in 1957 and has played host to acts like The Rolling
Stones, The Who, Queen and Elton John. Guitarist Mick Green _ who now plays in
Sir Paul's band _ appeared 11 times with Johnny Kidd And The Pirates.<
:: In 1973 The Cavern was filled in and the section above ground was
bulldozed. A new Cavern was set up nearby with little success, but in 1982 the
original venue was dug out and enlarged as a lasting tribute to The Beatles.<
