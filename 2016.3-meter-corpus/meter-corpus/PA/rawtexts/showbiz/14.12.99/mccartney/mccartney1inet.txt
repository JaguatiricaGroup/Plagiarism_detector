INTERNET BROADCASTS McCARTNEY GIG TO MILLIONS<
By Damien Pearse, PA News<
Rock legend Sir Paul McCartney tonight kicked off his concert at the small
Liverpool venue where he made his name, in front of one of the biggest audiences
of his life - thanks to the Internet.<
A capacity crowd of just 300 people packed The Cavern Club where McCartney
played with Lennon and Co for a lunchtime audience in 1961 for a fee of just
#5.<
But millions of others from across the globe were able to see the rock 'n'
roll show on the Internet.<
The concert was so popular that many people had trouble logging on to the
Internet sites because it was too congested.<
Viewers who were able to access the site could see and hear the former Beatles
legend and his band performing completely live with pictures transmitted into
cyberspace from web cameras at the venue.<
But UK internet servers were so congested that some could only connect to the
concert through a United States link.<
