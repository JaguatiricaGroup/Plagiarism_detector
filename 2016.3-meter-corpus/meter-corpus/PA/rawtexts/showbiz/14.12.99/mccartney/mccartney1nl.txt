CAVERN CLUB SIR PAUL ROCKS BACK THE CLOCK<
By Anthony Barnes, PA News Showbusiness Correspondent<
Music legend Sir Paul McCartney turned the clock back nearly four decades
tonight by playing in Liverpool's cramped Cavern Club _ only yards from the
original small sweaty venue where he was once an aspiring pop wannabe.<
To make the magic complete he performed one of the Beatles' songs he first
performed in the early 1960s _ I Saw Her Standing There _ as he returned to
Liverpool's Cavern Club.<
Just 300 lucky fans and guests had the privilege of seeing the 13-song
performance which lasted a little over 40 minutes. <
``Welcome to the Cavern _ it's been a long time coming, it's great to be
back,'' the multi-millionaire star announced after the ear splitting opening
song Honey Hush.<
However even Sir Paul pointed out that it was not quite the same place, which
he last played in 1963. <
``You know this isn't exactly where the Cavern was.<
``It's over there somewhere, buried under that heap of rubble,'' he said,
gesturing towards the back of the underground, low ceiling room.<
``Another brilliant city council decision. `I know, let's fill in the Cavern,
that's a good idea.' Never mind,'' Sir Paul said of the demise of the former
venue where it all began.<
Sir Paul's set was made up mainly of the rock-`n'-roll standards of his recent
back-to-basics album Run Devil Run.<
And they included the Ricky Nelson song Lonesome Town, of which both he and
his late wife Linda were huge fans in their teens.<
``This is dedicated to loved ones past, present and future,'' he said as he
introduced it.<
