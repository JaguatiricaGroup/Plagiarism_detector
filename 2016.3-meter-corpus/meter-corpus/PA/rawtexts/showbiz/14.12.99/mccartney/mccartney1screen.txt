THOUSANDS PACK PARK TO WATCH MACCA'S RETURN<
By Mark Benattar, PA News<
Thousands of fans braved freezing weather to watch a live big screen relay of
Sir Paul McCartney's return to the Cavern Club tonight.<
The former Beatle jetted into Liverpool today to play the Mathew Street venue
which made him famous.<
Sir Paul took to the Cavern stage at 8pm to entertain the lucky few while
thousands of others watched the performance beamed from the club to a 20ft
screen at the nearby Chavaffe Park.<
Fan Pat Oakes, who worked at the Cavern Club in its heyday, watched the
spectacle with her nine-year-old granddaughter Charlotte who had travelled from
London.<
Charlotte said: ``I'm visiting my nanny and granddad so I could come to see
Paul McCartney play.<
``My mum and my granny both love the Beatles but my favourite is the
Backstreet Boys. But I think Paul McCartney's really good.''<
Pat added: ``When they were first on in the Cavern when I used to work there
they weren't that big. It wasn't until they went to Germany they became huge.<
``It's great to see him back here. It's just a shame they all split up and it
would be lovely to see the remaining Beatles back together. It would have been
really nice tonight.''<
