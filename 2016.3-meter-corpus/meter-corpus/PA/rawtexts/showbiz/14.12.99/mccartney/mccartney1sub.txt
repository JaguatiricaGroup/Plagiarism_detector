IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK, SAYS McCARTNEY<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Rock legend Sir Paul McCartney tonight returned to the Liverpool venue where
he made his name and said: ``It's fantastic to be back at The Cavern.''<
The former Beatles star was speaking prior to his show at the tiny
subterranean club, his first there for 36 years.<
Sir Paul first played the Cavern with Lennon and Co for a lunchtime audience
in 1961 for a fee of just #5.<
Now one of the biggest names in the music world he has returned to his roots
for the concert.<
He said tonight: ``This is where it all began and for me this is where the
century is going to end when we play rock 'n' roll.<
``Remember the Beatles, before the Beatles, was a fabulous rock 'n' roll band.
That was what held us together for so long and made us so good, I think - he
said modestly,'' the musician joked.<
``I'm back here because I love Liverpool and there's no better place to rock
out the century.''<
Sir Paul has kept the contents of the show closely under wraps but it is bound
to feature a string of rock 'n' roll anthems.<
He said: ``I've come back because I've done a rock 'n' roll album called Run
Devil Run and I want to plug it.''<
Just 300 people will witness the performance in the venue. However up to
15,000 will be able to see it on a giant video screen in Liverpool's Chavasse
Park and a global audience of millions will be able to see it on the Internet.<
Fans flocked round the entrance to the Cavern Club this evening to catch a
glimpse of their hero, but tight security meant that few could even get close to
the venue's entrance.<
Director of The Cavern, Bill Heckle, said: ``Rock 'n' roll history will be
made tonight in Liverpool. It will be loud, hot and sweaty - just the way rock
'n' roll should be.<
``In size, the show is tiny - but its mark will be made all around the
planet.''<
