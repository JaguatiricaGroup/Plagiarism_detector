Sir Paul looked in his element as he shook his head and swayed to the music
playing his familiar left-handed bass guitar.<
But during guitarist Dave Gilmour's solos he looked lost in thought and
contemplation.<
Delighted by the response of the eager crowd, who shook their arms and
shouted, he repeatedly asked them: ``Are you enjoying yourselves?''.<
His performance also included the classic Twenty Flight Rock, a favourite of
Sir Paul and John Lennon when they met in 1958.<
``There was one song and I knew the words to it. I think because I knew the
words to it, that's what got me in the Beatles,'' he said as he introduced it.<
His arrival on stage had been preceded by little ceremony.<
The silent room was simply told ``ladies and gentleman, with his band, Paul
McCartney''.<
The stage displayed nothing to show it was about to play host to one of the
world's most famous musicians, with just a simple projection of the name of the
club in white on a black background.<
After his fifth song, What It Is, Sir Paul voiced his excitement at being back
by telling the crowd ``it's good here innit'' to which one of the crowd shouted:
``Go on Macca lad.''<
Other songs included the classic All Shook Up, his new track Try Not to Cry
and he rounded off the main show with his Beatles standard I Saw Her Standing
There.<
The crowd shouted for their own favourites during a brief lull before he
launched into a single encore, but he told them with a grin: ``We're not doing
requests, we don't do requests.''<
After performing one bonus song, Party, he swept offstage teasing the crowd:
``Well, see you next time.''<
Fans won the right to see the show after their names were drawn in a ticket
raffle which took place last week, but half the crowd was made up of guests and
members of the press from around the world.<
Among those who saw the show was Jane King, 31, from Glossop, Derbyshire. <
She said: ``It was great to be here, but it was a bit of an anti-climax.<
``It just wasn't long enough. I've been a fan since I was about 13. The
highlight was when he played I Saw Her Standing There, because it was the one I
knew best.<
``I would have liked to have heard some of the older stuff, but I really
enjoyed it.''<
Also in the crowd was Hilary Medcalf, whose brother Roger had won tickets for
the pair of them.<
Hilary, 38, from Speke, Liverpool, said: ``I thought it was great, but I
thought it'd be much longer _ it didn't seem to be very long.<
``Paul was looking good and I thought he sounded great. I can imagine this is
what it was like in the old days, quite claustrophobic but a really good
atmosphere.''<
