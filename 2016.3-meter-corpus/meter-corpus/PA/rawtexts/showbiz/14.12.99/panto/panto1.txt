VIAGRA PANTO JOKE `CORRUPTS CHILDREN' _ MARY WHITEHOUSE<
By Brian Farmer, PA News<
A Christmas pantomime in which the audience is asked to chant ``Viagra'' to
raise the gates of a castle has been criticised by decency campaigner Mary
Whitehouse.<
Mrs Whitehouse said the mention of the impotence drug during performances of
Jack and the Beanstalk at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was
``corrupting''.<
But theatre managers today insisted that they would not change the script,
written by comedian Roy Hudd, saying they had received no complaints from
customers.<
Mrs Whitehouse has not seen the play but raised her concerns in a local
newspaper.<
``It's corrupting their innocence and doing it at Christmas time as well,''
she said. ``I think it should be dropped.''<
But a theatre spokeswoman dismissed the criticism saying the use of the word
``Viagra'' was in the tradition of panto.<
``It's a joke that's meant for the parents and it gets lots of laughs. I have
no doubt that it goes straight over the heads of children,'' she said.<
``As in all pantos, there is a bit of mild sexual innuendo in the script. They
are jokes aimed at the adults in the audience.<
``We have had no complaints from anyone who has seen the panto, and we've been
playing to packed houses, so we don't plan to change the script.''<
