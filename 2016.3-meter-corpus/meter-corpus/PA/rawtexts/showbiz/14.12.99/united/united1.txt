CHARLES M. SCHULZ, CREATOR OF PEANUTS, TO RETIRE<
   <
   :: PR Newswire, London, December 14. This press release is transmitted on
behalf of United Media.<
   <
   New York - Charles M. (''Sparky'') Schulz, creator of the PEANUTS comic strip,
will retire January 4th, 2000. In a letter to his readers, colleagues, fellow
cartoonists and friends, Schulz wrote:<
   <
   ``I have always wanted to be a cartoonist, and I feel very blessed to have
been able to do what I love for almost 50 years. That all of you have embraced
Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus and all the other PEANUTS characters has
been a constant motivation for me.<
   <
   ``It is important for me to tell you personally that I have decided to retire
from drawing the PEANUTS comic strip, after the daily release of Monday, January
3rd, 2000, (and Sunday release of February 13th), in order to concentrate on my
treatment for and recuperation from colon cancer. Although I feel better
following my recent surgery, I want to focus on my health and my family without
the worry of a daily deadline.<
   <
   ``Thank you for your kindness and support over the years and for the
outpouring of good wishes since my surgery.''<
   <
   In accordance with the wishes of Mr. Schulz, his last original daily strip
will appear on Monday, January 3rd, and his last original Sunday will appear on
February 6. Beginning on Tuesday, January 4th, for dailies (and February 20th
for Sundays), we will be offering our PEANUTS clients comic strips originally
drawn in 1974.<
   <
   The year 1974 was chosen as the roll-out year for Classic Peanuts because it
incorporates the characters of the strip's very early days (Charlie Brown, Lucy,
Schroeder and Snoopy) with popular characters that were introduced in later
years such as Peppermint Patty and Woodstock. The strips that he drew in 1974
unite the genius of comic timing and dialogue with the artwork of a master.<
   <
   On October 2, 1950, Charles M. Schulz's PEANUTS comic strip first appeared
in seven newspapers. Growing from that original seven to more than 2,600 today,
PEANUTS is the most widely syndicated comic strip in history. On a daily basis,
PEANUTS reaches more than 355 million readers in 75 countries and 21 languages.
Its timeless and endearing humor has expanded into more than 50 animated
television specials, more than 1,400 books selling 300 million copies, and four
feature films.<
