TOO MUCH SEX ON TV, SAYS GRIMLEYS STAR<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
TV beauty Amanda Holden today criticised the levels of sex on television _ and
blamed directors for believing that was what the public wanted.<
The Grimleys star, who will soon be seen in a bath scene in BBC1's Happy
Birthday Shakespeare, said: ``I do think there's an awful lot of stuff on
television that is unnecessary, without wanting to sound like my grandmother.''<
She singled out the Robson Green ITV drama The Last Musketeer for its
inclusion of a topless scene which added nothing to the plot.<
``It's just typical of directors that they think the public want to see that
sort of thing. It's better left to hands, faces and noises.''<
Next month the actress, who has featured in a number of sitcom roles, will be
seen in a seven-part drama Hearts And Bones alongside Dervla Kirwan and The Full
Monty's Hugo Speer (correct).<
``There are a couple of scenes that involve sex in that show but they focus on
the faces. It's much more interesting than a***s and chests,'' she said.<
Holden, who has posed in her underwear for a men's magazine and appeared in
stockings and suspenders in The Grimleys, added: ``They should leave it to
people's imaginations.''<
The actress, married to Family Fortunes host Les Dennis, said her rising TV
profile meant she now felt more ``empowered'' to stand up and argue her case
that shows do not need such raunchy scenes.<
And she pointed out the extent of flesh displayed for her bath scene in Happy
Birthday Shakespeare, to be shown on Easter Sunday, had been exaggerated.<
``I keep reading articles about my first nude scene. I have bubbles up to my
chin and I had a bikini on,'' she said.<
In Hearts And Bones _ which begins in May _ Holden plays one of a group of
friends from Coventry who make new lives for themselves in London.<
