BECKHAMS THREATEN COURT BAN ON MORTON BOOK<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Royal author Andrew Morton is facing legal action to stop him writing a
biography of celebrity couple David and Victoria Beckham, it emerged today.<
The controversial writer, who has penned number one bestsellers on the late
Diana, Princess of Wales and Monica Lewinsky, is writing a joint profile of the
Spice Girl and her soccer ace husband.<
But today his publisher, Michael O'Mara, said he had received a letter from
the couple's solicitor threatening a legal injunction to prevent the book
hitting the shelves.<
``We've had a letter from solicitors representing the Beckhams saying they
will take out an injunction if we go ahead,'' he said. ``I think they are trying
to scare us off the subject, but I don't believe an attempt to go for an
injunction would succeed.''<
Mr O'Mara said Morton, whose books Diana: Her True Story and Monica's Story
caused storms when they were published, was currently researching his latest
project.<
He revealed that, as well as talking to a host of people with close personal
knowledge of the Beckhams, he would be approaching the couple themselves.<
``Andrew doesn't write slamming books,'' he said. ``He tries to write
well-rounded portraits.''<
A spokeswoman for the Spice Girls said earlier today she could not comment on
reports that the Beckhams had threatened Morton's publishers with an
injunction.<
The new biography, Posh and Becks: A Marriage, will explore what the
publishers describe as ``the truth behind the headlines'' about the celebrity
pair.<
As well as examining Victoria's relationships with her fellow Spice Girls, it
will look into David's with his team, Manchester United, and its manager, Sir
Alex Ferguson.<
The book will also consider the couple's status as ``king and queen of popular
culture'', while musing on the recent addition to their family in the form of
baby Brooklyn.<
