PRODUCERS TURNED `DIRTY DAN INTO BALLET DANCER'<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
EastEnders star Craig Fairbrass has revealed how he chose to quit the hit soap
because his hardman character was starting to look like a ``ballet dancer''.<
The actor, whose character ``Dirty'' Dan Sullivan departs next week, told Now
magazine he initially loved playing the cad who two-timed Carol Jackson with her
daughter Bianca.<
But after later scripts saw him being rude to Peggy Mitchell and getting
beaten up by her husband Frank, he decided to quit.<
``It was `has Dan become a ballet dancer overnight?','' said Fairbrass. ``All
of a sudden, I'm getting my ears boxed by the likes of Frank. It was frustrating
and it aggravated and upset me.''<
The 34-year-old heart-throb added that the characterisation got even worse
after he complained to the show's producers.<
Fairbrass confirmed reports that he and actress Tamzin Outhwaite, who plays
Mel in the soap, were asked to tone down a passionate scene when it became too
heated.<
But he said that every time he had to kiss co-star Patsy Palmer (Bianca) she
burst out laughing.<
Following the Bianca/Carol storyline, he even had some indecent proposals from
real-life mothers and daughters.<
``The more horrible, the more of a bastard, the more women like you,'' he
said.<
Fairbrass also revealed how he has been cast in a science fiction movie, The
Lunatic Fringe, which he described as ``a cross between Mad Max and The Dirty
Dozen'', in which he will play a space marine.<
