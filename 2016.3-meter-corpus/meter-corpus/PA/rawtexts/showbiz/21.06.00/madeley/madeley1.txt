DIS MORNING I IS ALI G<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
This Morning host Richard Madeley today bowed to pressure to change his
trademark layered hairstyle - by adopting the look of spoof rapper Ali G.<
The presenter swapped his usual dapper image to sport a bright yellow shell
suit and hat at the start of the ITV programme.<
Madeley even sported Ali G's beard and spoke in his distinctive ``gangsta
lingo'' as he discussed ideas he had for the show with bemused co-host Judy
Finnigan.<
As Finnigan struggled to keep a straight face, Madeley said: ``I 'as some
ideas here for Dis Morning. I would like to run some things past you.''<
In a fun swipe at the show's traditional makeover slot, he joked: ``Why does
you bother wid all these makeovers? Why don't you just get women who is fit to
start with?''<
When Finnigan said she was not prepared to present the whole programme with
Madeley dressed as Ali G, he asked: ``Is it because I is black?''<
Madeley's new look followed a phone-in poll on yesterday's show giving viewers
the chance to vote on which of four celebrities he should try to emulate.<
More than 50% of voters said he should opt for Ali G chic, as opposed to the
images of Travis lead singer Fran Healy, footballer David Beckham or long-haired
Changing Rooms style guru Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.<
The poll followed an article in Saturday's edition of The Sun poking fun at
Madeley for retaining the same hairstyle since he first appeared on This Morning
a decade ago.<
