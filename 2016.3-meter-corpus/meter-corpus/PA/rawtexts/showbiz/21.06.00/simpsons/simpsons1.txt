SIMPSONS ACTORS HEADING FOR BRITAIN<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The actors whose voices are behind the cult cartoon sitcom The Simpsons are
flying to Britain to stage live readings of scripts from the show.<
A unique tour of key festival venues is being staged to coincide with the 10th
anniversary of the internationally acclaimed series later this summer.<
While a similar read-through was held at the Aspen Comedy Festival earlier
this year, this is the first time such a venture has been staged in the UK.<
Series creator Matt Groening said today: ``We are looking forward to this tour
and hope to do to England and Scotland what the Simpsons have done to America.<
``I think the most amazing thing is that the actors really look like the
characters that they play.''<
David Bergg, general manager of Sky One, which is organising the tour to
celebrate the birthday of the series, which it has screened since its 1990
launch, added: ``Like all Simpsons fans, I'm thrilled that the people behind one
of the best television programmes in history are bringing some of the magic over
to Britain for its 10th anniversary.''<
The brief tour will kick off at the Edinburgh fringe festival, with a
performance at The Assembly Rooms on Monday August 14.<
It will be followed by two more shows, on Thursday August 17 and Friday 18.<
The show's celebrations will also include a one-day Simpsons event at London's
National Film Theatre, followed by a weekend of special programmes on Sky One.<
All the actors who provide the voices for the principal Simpsons characters
will be present at the events, including Dan Castellaneta, alias Homer, Nancy
Cartwright (Bart) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa).<
:: BBC2 is to screen a three-hour Simpsons Night in honour of the yellow
cartoon creations this Friday, from 6pm to 9.10pm.<
