`INTERNET STALKER TARGETING WINSLET'<
By Mick McGann, PA News<
Titanic star Kate Winslet is being targeted by an internet stalker who has
sent several email death threats to a fan club website, her New York-based agent
said tonight.<
Robert Garlock said police were contacted after the 24-year-old actress's
London agents, Peters, Fraser and Dunlop, received an email warning that she may
be in danger.<
Mr Garlock would not comment further.<
According to The Mirror newspaper, the stalker is female, and the email was
headed ``Winslet stalker info _ urgent!'', and read: ``There could be harm for
Kate.''<
In a string of emails to the unofficial Kate Winslet Fan Club site, the
stalker, who calls herself Dina, says she will visit London and wants to
``rape'', ``kill'' and ``hit'' the pregnant star.<
Another message, referring to Winslet's new home in Britain, said: ``That flat
sounds cool ... I can get her addy (internet slang for address) then!!
hahaaaaa.''<
The messages have been traced to the literature department of the Aristotle
University in Thessalonica, Greece.<
Winslet had to take action under the Protection from Harassment Act two years
ago when a man claiming to be a photographer began following her around.<
The man was eventually arrested, warned to stop stalking her and freed without
charge.<
Winslet, who is expecting her first child in September, has recently returned
home after filming Enigma, the movie based on Robert Harris's novel about
wartime code-breakers.<
