DIAMONDS STILL FOREVER FOR BOND'S GIRL<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
James Bond leapt back into action tonight at the premiere of the new 007
movie, but it was the girl on his arm that dazzled the crowds _ draped in jewels
worth a cool #3.5 million.<
Pierce Brosnan's girlfriend, Keeley Shaye Smith, wore a necklace with 51
diamonds and a pair of matching earrings as the couple arrived in London's
Leicester Square.<
They were among the guests at a star-studded event to launch Bond's 19th movie
The World is not Enough <
Stage and screen veteran Dame Judi Dench also pleased the crowds by arriving
with her husband, the actor Michael Williams who was diagnosed with lung cancer
in the summer.<
Williams has made few public appearances since his condition became apparent
in August, but he was on the arm of Dame Judi _ who plays M in the new film _ as
the couple arrived at the Odeon, where Bond movies are traditionally launched.<
The signs are that the latest outing for the suave agent will be as successful
as the previous movies with the film going straight to the top of the US box
office chart over the weekend.<
It had its biggest opening weekend to date, taking #23.25 million _ beating
previous Bond record holder, Goldeneye, which took #16.3 million.<
Brosnan, appearing for the third time as Bond, wore a dark tuxedo with a
blue-grey waistcoat as he arrived tonight, rather than the dinner suit and black
tie for which the screen hardman is best known.<
He topped it off with a diamond and pearl pin from Asprey & Garrard which also
supplied the jewels for Shaye Smith.<
She wore a dark claret silk dress designed by Richard Tyler.<
