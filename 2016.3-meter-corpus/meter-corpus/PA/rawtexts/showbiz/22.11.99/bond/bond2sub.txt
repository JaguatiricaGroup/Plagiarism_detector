  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the first 007 film, Dr No in 1962, the films have been renowned for the
glamour of the Bond girls and tonight's premiere was no exception.<
US actress Denise Richards, who plays Dr Christmas Jones, wore a powder pink
dress which sparkled as it caught the light as she arrived with director Michael
Apted.<
Maria Grazia Cucinotta _ the curiously named Cigar Girl in the film _ wore a
plunging black dress, while Sophie Marceau (who plays Elektra, the daughter of a
British oil tycoon) wore an eyecatching tropical print dress split to the
thigh.<
Brosnan, 47, said as he arrived: ``The story's very good and hopefully I
played the part in a convincing manner.<
``This is my third outing. When it works really well no other film stands up
to it.''<
Asked is there were any hairy moments during filming, the Irish actor said:
``There are always a lot of hairy moments _ just going to work in the morning
was hairy.''<
Robert Carlyle, the evil Renard, said: ``It's always nice playing a baddie. I
really enjoy filming.<
``Pierce is one of the nicest men I've ever met. He made me feel really
welcome.''<
Other guests at the premiere, which raised money for the Children's Promise
charity, included Sir Paul McCartney, former Six Million Dollar Man star Lee
Majors, Desmond Llewellyn, who plays Q, and Robbie Coltrane.<
Pregnant Emma Thompson was accompanied by her partner Greg Wise.<
Guests were due to attend a party at the Naval and Military Club in London _

appearance there.<

Ireland on Friday.<
