ALL-STAR LINE-UP FOR BBC'S CHRISTMAS CRACKER<
By Karen Edwards, PA News<
The BBC has chosen a Dickensian theme for its Christmas schedule with a
star-studded adaptation of David Copperfield as the centrepiece.<
With big name stars such as Bob Hoskins, Nicholas Lyndhurst, Dawn French,
Pauline Quirke, Trevor Eve and Zoe Wanamaker in the line-up, the Corporation is
promoting the Charles Dickens' classic as a festive cracker.<
The new adaptation will feature alongside comedies The Vicar of Dibley, The
Royle Family, They Think It's All Over and Never Mind the Christmas Buzzcocks.<
EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City will also retain their usual slots.<
BBC1 controller Peter Salmon said: ``Every year we save some really special
things to put in the Christmas sack, and this year - the last of the century -
we have created the ultimate toy box to keep the viewers amused for the whole
fortnight.<
``I can't think of a better way to wish our viewers the best of times than
through the creative genius of our programme makers.<
``With The Vicar of Dibley promising to be a real event, Dervla Kirwan in the
heart-warming story the Greatest Store in the World and the unique historical
record unfolding in the Century in 100 minutes, BBC1 is guaranteed to keep
families and friends together this Christmas.''<
Other BBC1 Christmas highlights include a modern day Christmas fairy tale
staring Ray Winstone and Pauline Quirke called Last Christmas and special
festive editions of Jonathan Creek and Dinnerladies.<
Comedy duo Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke team up for a teenage rampage as the
characters Kevin and Perry.<
BBC2 will show a behind-the-scenes look at the Millennium Dome called The
Dome: Trouble at the Big Top.<
Verdi's Falstaff live from the Royal Opera House spearheads the channel's
musical schedule which also includes Carols from King's, The Rodgers and Hart
Story and a performance of Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty.<
BBC2 controller Jane Root said: ``This is my first Christmas with the channel
and I've put something distinctly BBC2 in the sack for everyone - from a rich
range of music and arts to a night celebrating top name chefs.<
``BBC2 is the channel of innovation, dedicated to pursuing personal passions
in ever clever and new ways - this Christmas we keep up our tradition of
non-tradition.''<
