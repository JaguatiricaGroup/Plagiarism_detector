CILLA WINS BATTLE OF THE REDHEADS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Cilla Black won the ratings battle of the redheads as Blind Date pulled in
three million more viewers than Lulu's new National Lottery show.<
The first edition of the new series of Cilla's long-running show had an
average of 9.7 million viewers on Saturday against Red Alert With The National
Lottery's 6.3 million.<
A spokeswoman for London Weekend Television, which makes Blind Date, said they
were delighted with the audience.<
The programmes _ both fronted by Sixties singing icons who hosted their own
shows three decades ago _ were pitched head-to-head, starting at 7.10pm.<
Blind Date's format has survived into its 15th series while Lulu's programme
was already being tweaked in just the second show. The voice of TV darts, Sid
Waddell, was dropped.<
A spokeswoman for Red Alert said: ``How many times do we have to say we're not
in a ratings battle with ITV?<
``What we are about is offering something new. This is a new show and we're
the only channel that is trying to do something new for Saturday nights.''<
Richard Whiteley's pilot programme for BBC1 on Friday night was, however, a
ratings winner for the Beeb.<
His Unbriefed show _ in which he is unaware of who the guests are beforehand _
had an audience of 5.5 million compared to Ian Wright's ITV chat show Friday
Night's All Wright which had 3.3 million viewers.<
Whiteley said: ``I'm quietly thrilled that 5.5 million people would rather
watch me than get last orders in the pub. But Michael Parkinson doesn't have
anything to worry about yet.''<
