NEW SOAP SPEARHEADS BBC DAYTIME DRIVE<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
BBC1 is to produce a new soap set in a GP's practice to spearhead its daytime
schedules, it was announced today.<
The new series - provisionally titled The Practice - is being overseen by
former Brookside producer Mal Young and will begin filming in January, following
the lives of the doctors and nurses.<
Another new show, A Family Of My Own, will look at children in care and will
encourage families to consider adoption.<
``This is an important initiative for daytime and a great example of the
public service broadcasting we aim to provide,'' said Jane Lush, the BBC's head
of daytime TV.<
The BBC has been working with the Department of Health, social services and
fostering and adoption agencies throughout the UK to produce the show, which
will be presented by Sally Magnusson.<
Each show will feature case studies of children available for adoption chosen
by social services, as well as success stories of families that have
successfully adopted.<
The shows are a move away from the game shows, light entertainment and chat
that have become synonymous with daytime programmes.<
Ms Lush said: ``BBC Daytime will offer viewers a real alternative to other
channels with programming of range and ambition that will reflect and complement
their own lives.<
``BBC Daytime is the viewers' friend and I hope the audience will consider
their time well spent watching the programmes we have lined up.''<
Some new shows will be shown before Christmas. These include Classic Cafe,
which to be broadcast once a week live from the newly revamped Royal Opera House
in Covent Garden and focusing on the world of opera, ballet and dance.<
And on BBC2 Lowri Turner will present Shopping City which will be broadcast
live from Manchester's Trafford Centre.<
Other forthcoming shows include Passport To The Sun, presented by Channel 4's
Big Breakfast star Liza Tarbuck from the Spanish island of Majorca and Maternity
Hospital in which Sue Cook looks behind the scenes at St Mary's Hospital in
Manchester.<
Alice Beer and Diarmud Gavin present gardening show Real Rakeovers and David
Dickinson will give an insider's guide to the world of collectibles in Bargain
Hunt.<
Earlier this year BBC Daytime was hit by the scandal of fake guests on The
Vanessa Show and poor ratings. It was eventually axed.<
Ms Lush said: ``This has been a challenging year for BBC Daytime but we are
making real progress.<
``BBC Daytime is not only committed to providing the audience with bold, fresh
and innovative ideas that will entertain but also programming that is both
ambitious and relevant to our audience.''<
