ARCHERS FANS SET FOR SID'S AFTER SEX SHOWER SIZZLER<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Fans of cult radio soap The Archers will tonight hear one of its steamiest
ever scenes _ when local flirt Jolene shares an after-sex shower with adulterous
landlord Sid Perks.<
The long-running series, set in the fictional village of Ambridge, has had its
fair share of controversies since its first broadcast in January 1951.<
Over the last 49 years the ostensibly innocent and gentle chronicle of country
life has been criticised for its use of swear words and the often violent deaths
which have befallen its characters.<
But tonight's episode is set to put all but a few earlier ``scandals'' in the
shade when married landlord Perks is heard sharing a shower with seductress
Jolene and discussing with her their preceding sex romp.<
Speculation about the exact nature of the clinch has been rife for some time,
although Archers producers have remained tight-lipped.<
Controversy erupted after editor Vanessa Whitburn was reported as saying it
would be more ``explicit'' than the series had ever been before, with
Canterbury's Tory MP, Julian Brazier, accusing the programme of going too far.<
A Radio Four spokesman on Wednesday confirmed the long-awaited scene would be
included in tonight's episode, but declined to give any details of exactly what
it contained.<
