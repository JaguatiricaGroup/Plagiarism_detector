RADIO SEX SCENE PROVES GOOD CLEAN FUN<
By Tom Kelly, PA News<
A much hyped after sex shower scene on cult radio soap the Archers was tonight
denounced as a huge anti-climax.<
Fans of the show had been anticipating a steamy encounter after reports that
adulterous landlord Perks would be heard rubbing down seductress Jolene as they
discussed their sex romp.<
Controversy erupted after editor Vanessa Whitburn was reported as saying it
would be more ``explicit'' than the series had ever been before, with
Canterbury's Tory MP, Julian Brazier, accusing the programme of going too far.<
But the event turned out to be nothing more than good clean entertainment,
with most of the dialogue about what soap to use.<
A spokeswoman for the BBC said they had only received a handful of calls about
tonight's show, and one of them had been complaining that there was not enough
``huffing and puffing''.<
``I think it was a bit blown out of proportion. We never said it was going to
be an actual sex scene. One caller complained about what a let-down it was.''<
The long-running series, set in the fictional village of Ambridge, has had its
fair share of controversies since its first broadcast in January 1951.<
Over the last 49 years the ostensibly innocent and gentle chronicle of country
life has been criticised for its use of swear words and the often violent deaths
which have befallen its characters.<
