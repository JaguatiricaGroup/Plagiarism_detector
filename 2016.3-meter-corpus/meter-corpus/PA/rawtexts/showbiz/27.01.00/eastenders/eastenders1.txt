BBC DENIES EASTENDERS IS SET FOR EXTRA NIGHT<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
BBC chiefs today moved to quash speculation that top-rated soap EastEnders was
poised to go on air four nights a week.<
A report in tomorrow's issue of industry journal Broadcast claims proposals to
increase the number of weekly episodes from three to four have been under
discussion ``for some time''.<
It cites the arrival of incoming director general Greg Dyke, who takes over
from Sir John Birt on Saturday, as the reason it has been put back on the
agenda.<
But the BBC's drama commissioner for series and serials, Alan Ayres, today
denied there was any prospect of a fourth regular episode of EastEnders in the
foreseeable future.<
``We've no plans to introduce a fourth episode of EastEnders,'' he said.
``Nothing is ever off the agenda completely, but there are no plans of this
sort.''<
At present, EastEnders regularly attracts audiences of more than 16 million
for its thrice-weekly episodes, on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and its
Sunday afternoon omnibus edition.<
