LAMARR HEADS FOR NEW LOOK<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News.<
Comedian Mark Lamarr will shave off his trademark ``Fifties throwback'' hair
style live on the Big Breakfast, he said today.<
The 32-year-old star will be given the chop by presenter and friend Gail
Porter during Monday's episode of the Channel 4 breakfast show - the day before
he embarks on a nationwide stand-up tour.<
And the hair will be auctioned with proceeds going to his chosen charity,
World Vision.<
Lamarr, whose distinctive oiled quiff has become known to millions since he
first found fame on Channel 4's The Word, said he was taking the drastic action
because he is bored of people mentioning it.<
``I did about 30 interviews last week and every single person asked me about
my hair and Gail Porter, so I thought if I get Gail to cut it off live on the
Big Breakfast that should end it once and for all,'' he said.<
``It seems strange to me that I've been a stand-up for 15 years and people go
on about this, when it has absolutely no input into my style.''<
He added: ``I suppose I will miss it, in a way. It's been a constant companion
to me for so long. I feel like I'm drowning an unwanted kitten.<
``The weirdest thing will be to find out what shape my head really is.<
``I've thought for ages `I've got to get a new hair style', but I've always
had another series to do, so I've ended up thinking `well, I'll just do this
series first'.''<
Despite being willing to shed his locks, Lamarr is adamant he does not want a
totally bald head.<
``It'll probably be a crew cut or something, but I'll have to have words with
Gail beforehand to warn her,'' he said.<
``When I first started wearing glasses, on the first night I went out on stage
someone yelled out straight away `you four-eyed git', so it will probably be
`baldy' next time.''<
