Rock star Noel Gallagher and his wife Meg Mathews are the latest in a string
of celebrities to choose an unusual name for their offspring _ by naming the
baby after the author of erotic French novels.<
The name Anais is by tradition a French Christian name, derived from the Greek
meaning ``fruitful''.<
It gained a certain notoriety from the French writer Anais Nin _ Meg's
favourite author _ though it is probably best known in this country as the name
of a perfume.<
The Gallagher baby will join a generation of youngsters given unconventional
names by their superstar parents.<
Noel's own brother Liam and his wife Patsy named their child Lennon, after the
Oasis singer's idol John Lennon.<
Perhaps the most notable of recent arrivals is Brooklyn Beckham, child of
Manchester United star David Beckham and his pop star wife Posh Spice, named
after his place of conception.<
Spice Girl Mel B, recently split from her husband Jimmy Gulzar, named her
daughter Phoenix Chi.<
Meanwhile TV presenter Jonathan Ross, known for his parental devotion, named
his children Honey Kinney, Harvey Kirby and Betty Kitten.<
