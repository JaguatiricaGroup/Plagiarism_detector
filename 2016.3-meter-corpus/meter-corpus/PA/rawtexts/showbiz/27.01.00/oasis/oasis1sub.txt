NOEL WEEPS TEARS OF JOY AFTER DAUGHTER'S BIRTH<
By Damien Pearse and Nell Raven, PA News<
Oasis star Noel Gallagher burst into tears as his wife gave birth to a baby
girl today - then nipped to a nearby pub for a pint of Guinness.<
He described the experience as ``the best thing ever'' and said everything had
gone to plan.<
His wife Meg Mathews gave birth to the 7lb 6oz baby at the Portland Hospital
in central London at 1.17pm.<
The couple have named the child Anais after Meg's favourite French author
Anais Nin. Anais means ``fruitful'' in Greek.<
Noel was present throughout the induced birth, which was not due for another
two weeks.<
He said: ``It was that big that the doctor said it was best to take it out
before it got any bigger.''<
The musician's mother Peggy and Meg's mother Chris were also at the hospital
along with her best friend Fran Cutler and the couple's housekeeper.<
Speaking from a pub opposite the hospital, Noel said the baby had blonde hair
and blue eyes and looked like her mother.<
``You feel a bit of an idiot standing there but once it's happened it's the
best thing ever,'' he said.<
``I'm still shaking. I thought there was going to be lots of screaming and
shouting all the way through but there wasn't.<
``Everything's worked out as we hoped it would.''<
Noel said his wife had coped admirably with the pain of labour.<
``It's just like she's been shopping. She looks fantastic - she doesn't even
look like she's had a baby.''<
Asked whether he had found the experience emotional he replied: ``I was crying
a lot.''<
Despite the happy scene at the hospital Noel decided to head for the nearest
pub to celebrate.<
``They were all drinking champagne and I don't like champagne so I came to the
pub,'' he said.<
According to Noel the baby was conceived at Christian Dior's house in
Montreaux, while he was making his latest album Standing On The Shoulder of
Giants.<
He said Meg would probably be staying at the hospital until the weekend, but
they hoped to be able to leave in time to attend the Mike Tyson v Julius Francis
fight in Manchester on Saturday.<
Describing how it felt to be a father Noel said: ``It might bring out my
feminine side and all that.''<
He said his mother was overjoyed at the news.<
``She's got three boys. This is the only girl in the family apart from her,''
the star added.<
Last year Noel, 32, and Meg, 33, quit London to live in a #2.5 million mansion
in Buckinghamshire.<
Meg, a builder's daughter who was brought up in Norfolk, said one of the
reasons for moving out of London was because she did not want to raise children
in the capital.<
She met her superstar husband in 1994 before joining Oasis's record company
Creation where she helped organise after show parties.<
Soon after marrying Noel in 1997 Meg left Creation to set up her own company 2
Active with Ms Cutler.<
Gallagher's brother Liam became a father for the first time five months ago
when his wife Patsy Kensit gave birth to a baby boy, Lennon.<
