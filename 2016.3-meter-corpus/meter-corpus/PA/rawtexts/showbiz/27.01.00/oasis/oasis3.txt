Last year the couple quit London to live in a #2.5 million mansion in
Buckinghamshire.<
Ms Mathews said one of the reasons for moving out of London was because she
did not want to raise children in the capital.<
Ms Mathews, who was brought up in Norfolk and is the daughter of a builder,
met her superstar husband in 1994.<
The 33-year-old worked at Oasis's record company Creation and she helped
organise after show parties including the one at the band's outdoor concert at
Knebworth.<
Soon after marrying Gallagher in 1997 Ms Mathews left Creation to set up her
own company 2 Active with close friend Fran Cutler.<
Gallagher's brother Liam became a father for the first time five months ago
when his wife Patsy Kensit gave birth to a baby boy, Lennon.<
