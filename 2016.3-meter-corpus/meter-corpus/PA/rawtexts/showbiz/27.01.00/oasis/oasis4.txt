The baby has been named after Meg's favourite French author Anais Nin.<
She was born at the Portland Hospital in central London at 1.17pm.<
The birth was induced - the baby was not due for another two weeks.<
Noel said: ``It was that big that the doctor said it was best to take it out
before it got any bigger.''<
She has blonde hair and blue eyes and looks like Meg, he added.<
His mother Peggy, Meg's mother Chris, Fran Cutler and the couple's housekeeper
were also at the hospital.<
Noel added: ``It's just like she (Meg) has been shopping. She looks fantastic
- she doesn't even look like she's had a baby.<
``You feel a bit of an idiot standing there but once it's happened it's the
best thing ever.''<
He added: ``I'm still shaking. I thought there was going to be lots of
screaming and shouting all the way through but there wasn't.<
``Everything's worked out as we hoped it would.''<
Noel admitted that, although Meg remained calm throughout, he burst into tears
during the birth.<
As soon as it was over Noel went straight to a nearby pub to get himself a
pint of Guinness.<
He said: ``They were all drinking champagne and I don't like champagne so I
came in here.''<
Noel confessed that the baby was conceived at Christian Dior's house in
Montreaux, while he was making his latest album Standing On The Shoulder of
Giants.<
He said Meg would probably be staying at the hospital until the weekend, but
they hoped to be able to leave in time to attend the Mike Tyson and Julius
Francis fight on Saturday.<
Describing how it felt to be a father he said: ``It might bring out my
feminine side and all that.''<
He said his mother was ``overjoyed'' at the news.<
He said: ``She's got three boys. This is the only girl in the family apart
from her.''<
