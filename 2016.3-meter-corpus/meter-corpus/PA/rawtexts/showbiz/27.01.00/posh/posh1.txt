WEIGHT LOSS DID WORRY ME _ POSH<
By Emma Hibbs, PA News<
Posh Spice decided to go to doctors after being afraid that she was losing too
much weight, she has disclosed.<
Victoria made the admission in an interview with Michael Parkinson, to be
broadcast on BBC1 at 9.30pm tomorrow.<
The wife of England soccer star David Beckham said: ``It did worry me. I did
go to the doctors, it worried me because I started to get paranoid so I went to
the doctors and said look, is there anything wrong with me. I wanted to be
totally checked out because I was eating perfectly fine, exactly as I always
have done, and I was losing weight.<
  ``They just said it's just something that happens when you have children. My
mum lost three stone after she had my brother, so it's hereditary. I think that
I could probably do with putting on weight but I just eat what I eat and this is
the way I am.<
``I'd have breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack in between. Normal. It's quite
embarrassing, I was out at dinner the other night and I was eating and I ordered
a bowl of pasta and the man said would you like a large bowl or a small bowl,
you feel such an idiot. I've just got used to it now, I don't care what anybody
says.<
``We were out at dinner the other day and I was absolutely bursting for the
toilet and it's quite sad to think you can't even go to the toilet because if
you do, people are going to think you're throwing up.<
``What really freaked me out about the whole weight issue wasn't actually the
weight issue in the end, it was the fact that in the past if I'd been in the
press I'd been with the Spice Girls or with David and for the first time it was
just me.<
``I was completely singled out and I think it was the whole attention, just
the fact that people were that interested in me, that kind of freaked me out
more than anything really.''<
Victoria also said that the couple had hired a bodyguard for son Brooklyn
following kidnap threats.<
