Victoria told how she had stepped up security following the recent kidnap
threats to her and Brooklyn.<
She said: ``It's a lot more worrying because I've got a baby. There's been lot
of stuff in the press about people wanting to kidnap Brooklyn.<
``That was serious, I did have threats, the police were fantastic. Brooklyn
has a bodyguard with him now.<
``It's something that's really worrying, that's every parent's worst
nightmare, something happening to their child. That's scary.''<
Although Brooklyn is not yet a year old, Victoria has signed him up for a
private school.<
She said: ``Do you know there is only one place left in his class as well. A
lot of parents put their names down for school before they are actually even
born these days.<
``I am going to send him to a private school in the country. I'm not going to
send him to Eton or anywhere like that but I'm putting his name down at lots of
different schools up north and down south.<
``You know, who knows where he will be. I have to be so bloody diplomatic all
the time it drives me mad.''<
She also denied having gone under the surgeon's knife. She said: ``I haven't
had a boob job ... if I'd had a boob job done I would have done them bigger than
this. That's all I can say.''<
