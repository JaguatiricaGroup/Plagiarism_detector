CELLIST JULIAN STEPS OUT WITH HIS NEW LOVE<
By James Morrison, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News.<
Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber today stepped out in public for the first time
with the new love in his life.<
The 48-year-old musician, who divorced his wife Zohra last year, attended the
South Bank Show Awards at London's Savoy Hotel with 27-year-old girlfriend Roz
Hamandishe.<
After the ceremony, the couple spoke for the first time about how they met and
fell in love.<
And Zimbabwe-born Roz, who once appeared on Cilla Black's Blind Date, revealed
how she only found out who Julian was when she saw his gold discs arranged in
his toilet.<
Julian, who performed a funky, Brazilian-sounding version of the original
South Bank Show theme tune by his brother Lord Lloyd-Webber at the start of
today's event, said: ``We met just over a year ago, just before Christmas 1998.<
``I was in Brixton with some friends and went into this restaurant where Roz
was with her friends. Some of us already knew each other so we got talking. ``We
started out as friends, but for the past two or three months we've been seeing
increasingly more of each other.'' He added: ``It's very important to me to know
that I'm valued by someone for myself and I like to be with someone who's a
non-practising musician because otherwise it can get too claustrophobic.<
``I appreciate the fact that Roz is from a different background. That is very
important to me.''<
Roz, who lives alone in Surrey and works for a London-based recruitment
agency, said: ``We value our independence. I'm a working girl.''<
But she added: ``Julian is down-to-earth, sensitive, very passionate, and he
has lots of energy and zest for life.''<
Asked about the 21-year age gap between them, Roz said: ``I like Julian's
maturity - and his immaturity.''<
Now the couple is bound for Australia and New Zealand, where Julian is
embarking on an extensive tour next month.<
Roz said: ``I will be helping him carry his equipment and holding his hand
when he gets nervous.''<
After that, Julian is due to perform the Elgar Concerto at the Royal Albert
Hall in aid of a charity masterclass for young musicians, and he has plans to
release a CD of Brazilian-tinged jazz - including the rewritten South Bank Show
theme.<
