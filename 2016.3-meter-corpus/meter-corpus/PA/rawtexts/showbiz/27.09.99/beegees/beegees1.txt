ISLE OF MAN TO ISSUE BEE GEES STAMPS<
By Jackie Burdon, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Six stamps honouring the Bee Gees are to be issued by the island of their
birth _ where their mother once ran a Post Office.<
I've Gotta Get A Message To You was aptly one of the global hits to be
commemorated on the set of Isle Of Man stamps to be issued on October 12.<
``Not many people realise the Bee Gees were born here _ most people think they
come from Manchester or Australia,'' said an Isle of Man Post Office spokesman.<
All but the youngest musical brother Andy were born on the Isle of Man, and
eldest brother Barry was nine by the time the family moved to Manchester in
1955.<
Parents Hugh and Barbara and troubled Andy returned to the island in the
1970s, where Barbara ran the Union Mills sub-post office for some years.<
Due to rules surrounding the royal approval of stamps, none of the Bee Gees'
faces actually appear on the issue. Instead designs showed a CD, a map of the
Isle of Man and one of the Bee Gees song titles.<
Last year the surviving trio Barry, Robin and Maurice paid tribute to their
homeland by recording Ellan Vannin, the island's unofficial anthem.<
They now play it at all their concerts, against a backdrop of the island's
stunning scenery.<
Their spokeswoman said: ``We are very honoured that these stamps are being
issued.<
``The Isle of Man is part of the band's history, and the stamps link them to
the island in a very concrete way.''<
The island had influenced their music, she said.<
``This is an opportunity to increase worldwide recognition of the Isle of Man,
so in a way it is a pay back.<
``It is not infrequent that they pop over there, and certainly their mother
was on the Isle of Man this summer to say hello to old friends.<
``They have a lot of friends there and they are hoping to go back there and do
a commemorative concert in the future.''<
The stamps were being released to mark the 50th birthdays of twins Robin and
Maurice on December 22.<
I've Gotta Get A Message To You, a British number one in 1968, was the 29p
denomination.<
Other songs on the stamps from the brothers' long and hit-filled career were
Massachusetts (22p), Words (26p), Ellan Vannin (37p), You Win Again (38p), Night
Fever (66p), Stayin' Alive (90p) and last year's release Immortality (60p).<
Stamp expert Peter Jennings said: ``These attractive and unusual stamps will
be much sought after by fans of the Bee Gees as well as by stamp collectors and
non-collectors alike. They are a wonderful souvenir of a legendary pop group
from the Isle of Man.''<
