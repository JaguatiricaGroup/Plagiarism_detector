SPICE GIRLS JOIN MILLENNIUM SINGLE LINE-UP<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The Spice Girls have been recruited to join the growing list of stars on the
BBC's Millennium single It's Only Rock 'n' Roll.<
The group recorded their section of the song last week, performing a line of
the 1974 Rolling Stones hit which will also feature Fun Lovin' Criminals, Annie
Lennox and James Brown.<
It follows the success of the Children In Need record Perfect Day which
brought together numerous musical superstars and reached number one.<
The Spice Girls have notched up Christmas chart-toppers for the past three
years but in recent interviews have cast doubt about whether they will release a
seasonal single this December.<
However, the BBC song is to be released to figure in the first chart of the
year 2000, so the girls could make up for it by featuring on the first number
one of the Millennium.<
Ten artists have recorded their sections of the song including Jon Bon Jovi,
James Brown and Chrissie Hynde.<
Also understood to have been approached for the project - expected to feature
20 acts - are Stevie Wonder, BB King and members of the Womack family.<
A video is being produced to accompany the single.<
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``It's going to have the same sort of atmosphere as
the Perfect Day video but the essence of it will be these artists shaking their
thing.''<
