JUST THE TICKETS AS ROYAL OPERA HOUSE BOX OFFICE REOPENS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Eager ticket hunters were among the first members of the public to see inside
the massively redeveloped Royal Opera House today when the box office was
reopening ready for the building's relaunch in December.<
Waiting to welcome the first opera and ballet fans to cross the threshold at
around 8am will be Royal Ballet star Darcey Bussell.<
But visitors will have to wait until later in the year to see the #214 million
redevelopment in all its glory with access restricted tomorrow to just the box
office area.<
More than 87,000 tickets go on sale today and a round-the-clock phone booking
operation swings into operation to cope with expected demand.<
Phone lines will be open for 48 hours from 8am Monday to 8am Wednesday. After
that the lines will operate from 10am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday.<
A spokeswoman said: ``We are expecting a big surge at the beginning. We also
get a lot of bookings from overseas, from the Far East and America, and it is
going to be very useful for them.<
``They can call at a time that suits them, not just when Greenwich Mean Time
dictates.<
``The personal callers on Monday will be the first members of the public
through the doors.''<
The Royal Opera House will reopen to the public with a gala celebration on
December 4 after a #214 million rebuild _ nearly 29 months after the curtain
last came down.<
The main auditorium has a capacity of around 2,200, while the studio theatre
seats about 450.<
The December 4 event features performances from tenor Placido Domingo who is
guesting with The Royal Opera. Among The Royal Ballet guest artists are Sylvie
Guillem and Viviana Durante.<
A similar presentation three days earlier will be primarily for contributors
towards the redevelopment.<
On December 6, The Royal Opera opens its first season with a new production of
Verdi's Falstaff. Two days later, The Royal Ballet begins its season with A
Celebration of International Choreography.<
Last week officials announced the redevelopment appeal had raised #95 million
of its #100 million target.<
Together with the #78.5 million National Lottery award and the income from
shops in the new building in Covent Garden, central London, the appeal will
cover the #214 million redevelopment cost. Ten donors have given more than #1
million.<
  This autumn a seat-naming campaign will begin to continue the fund-raising
push.<
