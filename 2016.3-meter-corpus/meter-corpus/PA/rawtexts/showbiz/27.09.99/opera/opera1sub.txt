REVAMPED OPERA HOUSE THROWS OPEN ITS DOORS<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
The Royal Opera House threw its doors open to the public today for the first
time in more than two years as tickets for the new season went on sale.<
Many hardy opera-goers spent the night on the pavement to secure their seats,
while others joined them this morning to line the covered walkway outside the
revamped building in London's Covent Garden.<
The main auditorium will reopen to the public with a gala celebration on
December 4 after a #214 million rebuild _ nearly 29 months after the curtain
last came down.<
Early arrivals as the box office opened at 8am were greeted by Royal Ballet
star Darcey Bussell who was pleased with the turnout.<
``I was a bit worried so I brought my mum along to make up the numbers,'' she
said.<
``It's wonderful to see it like this today. It was hard to keep morale going
as we jumped in and out of different theatres while the doors were closed for
two years.''<
Although it was just the box office which most visitors saw today, some were
given a sneak preview of the main hall, much of which is still coated in plastic
until the opening proper.<
To meet the huge demand for tickets, the Opera House also opened a
round-the-clock phone booking service which will continue for 48 hours until 8am
on Wednesday. After that it will become a 10am to 8pm line.<
Among those towards the front of the queue was Milan Hasecic, one of five
Cambridge University students who has spent the night outside the building.<
The 26-year-old PhD student from Belgrade said: ``We are very much looking
forward to seeing the new establishment _ it is completely transformed from the
last time we were here. And it's great to have access from the centre of Covent
Garden rather than just hiding away as it did before.''<
Actress Dera Cooper was an early riser to secure her seat. <
``I was quite clever _ I got a taxi at 4am and got here at 4.30. But the
person next to me had been here all night and I'm ever so pleased,'' she said.<
``I've slept out before when the Kirov and the Bolshoi were here and I slept
on a lilo on the pavement. But I thought I'd give it up now I've got a little
older.<
``I'm a Friend of the Opera House so I had booked some performances ahead but
I happened to be walking around here last night and saw the queues and thought,
'why not give it a go,'  and get tickets for the opening celebration. It will be
something unique.<
``I've been coming here for years and years. Once you're bitten with the bug
it's like an illness.''<
Ms Cooper said it was wonderful to see the Opera House so near to completion.<
``I'm going to write to Chris Smith to thank him because I don't think this
would have been possible under the previous government.''<
