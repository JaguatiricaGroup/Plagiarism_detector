Tom Rivers of Deddington, Oxfordshire, was up at 3.10am today to make it to the
queue by 5.10am and get hold of tickets for a performance of Falstaff.<
``I'm very much looking forward to it,'' said Mr Rivers, a Friend of the ROH
who has been a visitor to the ROH since 1958.<
``People who like this sort of thing are pretty loyal,'' he added.<
David Dalby, of Islington, north London, cycled down to queue for tickets for
four productions - including the opening night with Placido Domingo and The
Royal Ballet's staging of The Nutcracker.<
``I timed it perfectly. I got here at 5am but one of the people next to me was
here at 11pm last night,'' he said.<
``Part of the reason for my extensive booking was that it my partner's
mother's 90th birthday is coming up so there are a couple of treats for her.''<
``I had been to the old Opera House a few times but I mainly go to the English
National Opera.<
On seeing the queues, Michael Kaiser, executive director of the ROH, said:
``I'm absolutely thrilled because what it shows is that so many people want to
come to this Opera House and the interest in opera and ballet is so strong - as
is the interest in the institution.<
American Mr Kaiser joined the Opera House 11 months ago after a number of
high-profile departures and criticism of the institution by the Culture Select
Committee and the Eyre Report.<
``When I came there were lots of challenges, but it's a beautifully planned
project which has been ongoing for many years and the result of a lot of hard
work.<
``There is some controversy still and I have to make a lot of decisions. Just
from speaking to people in the queue this morning I find that a lot of people
have completely opposing views on exactly the same issue.<
``I think what we've done is changed the emphasis more to people's hopes for
the future of this building and not dwell too much on the history. Let's let it
lie there and go forward.''<
The redevelopment costs are being financed through a #78 million National
Lottery grant, proceeds from sales of shops in the new building complex and a
#100 million appeal.<
Only #5 million more needs to be raised to meet the appeal target and Mr
Kaiser is quietly confident that it will be met.<
``It is always hard work to raise money but we feel very comfortable that we
can do that,'' he said.<
