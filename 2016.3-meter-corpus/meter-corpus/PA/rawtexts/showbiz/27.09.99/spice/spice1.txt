MEL'S MISSES MERSEYSIDE DERBY TO KICK OFF WORLD TOUR<
By Maria Breslin, PA News<
Spice Girl Mel C kicked off her solo world tour tonight and complained that
her hometown gig clashed with the Merseyside derby.<
Sporty, clad in a Liverpool Football Club away strip shirt and carrying a team
scarf, said she was looking forward to the show and playing in front of a home
crowd.<
But lifelong Liverpool supporter Mel joked: ``I'm gutted I'm missing the
match. I can't believe it's the same night as the derby. I mean, whose bad
planning was that, eh?''<
Nursing a cold, Spice Girl Mel said she had been assured she would be kept up
to date with the latest score from the wings of Liverpool's Royal Court
Theatre.<
The opening tour date coincides with the release of her first solo single
Goin' Down which she said was penned in Dublin and was about a failed
relationship.<
Goin' Down is taken from her first solo album Northern Star which is due to be
released in October.<
She denied there were any songs inspired by former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell
or her alleged relationship with Robbie Williams.<
The Spice Girl admitted her appearances over the summer had received a mixed
reaction but urged her fans to give her new songs a chance.<
She said the other Spice Girls had given their blessing to her whirlwind solo
tour adding that they were all really supportive of each other's projects.<
The 25-year-old also played down recent reports of her latest earnings and
also ruled out a life as a tax exile saying: ``I'm quite happy to pay my taxes.
I have got enough money, I want to give it to people who haven't.''<
The tour also includes dates in America and Australia.<
