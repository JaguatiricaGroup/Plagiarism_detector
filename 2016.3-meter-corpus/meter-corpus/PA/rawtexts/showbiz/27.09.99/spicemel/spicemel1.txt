`NAUGHTY' MEL WINDOW-SHOPS HUNKS FOR TV SHOW<
By Anthony Barnes, Showbusiness Correspondent, PA News<
Happily married Spice Girl Mel G picked some of the guests for her new music
TV show because she fancies them, she revealed today.<
The singer, whose black music series Pure Naughty begins on BBC2 on Sunday
afternoon, said: ``You can still window-shop when you're married, but you can't
buy.<
``I don't want to buy - I've got my husband and I'm madly in love,'' added the
star who married a year ago.<
Mel said she drew up a ``dream list'' of who she wanted to meet, although one
of her fantasy men Wesley Snipes will not be appearing.<
Her three Spice Girls colleagues might also put in an appearance on the
series, Mel revealed today<
``They want to come on it. I said `no way, you're not black'. That was a joke.
No, their faces might crop up on it from behind the sofa or something.<
``We always like to be involved in each other's stuff.''<
The music and talk show will be her first TV presenting role and will feature
music stars like TQ, DJ Krust and Saul Williams and Lynden David Hall.<
However there will also be white acts like former New Kids On The Block star
Jordan Knight and the mainly white Another Level.<
Executive producer of the show Angela Ferreira said: ``It's more to do with
the spirit of the music than the colour of the skin.''<
Mel, 24, has also branched out into a solo music career and modelled at London
Fashion Week but said her priorities work-wise were the Spice Girls and Pure
Naughty.<
She said: ``Between the four of us the predominant thing that dominates our
lives is the Spice Girls, but we have time off to do our own thing.''<
Baby Spice Emma Bunton also becomes a TV presenter next month with a slot on
the VH1 music channel.<
