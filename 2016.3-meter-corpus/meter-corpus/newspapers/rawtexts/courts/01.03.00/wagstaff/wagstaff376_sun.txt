CHANGING Rooms star Liz Wagstaff conned pals and colleagues out of nearly £60,000 by pretending she had cancer, a court heard yesterday.

Wagstaff, 38, is said to have told 14 people that she needed cash for medical treatment because she was terminally ill.

BBC co-hosts Anna Ryder-Richardson and Mike Jewitt each gave her £500 while the wife of anchorman Lawrence Llewellyn-Bowen handed over £3,500, Inner London Crown Court heard.

Other alleged victims include her ex-lover Mark Thurgood, who is said to have given her £12,000.

The interior designer - who made five appearances in the hit makeover show - faces 19 charges of obtaining a total of £55,650 by deception between July 1998 and last August.

Wagstaff of Stevenage, Herts, denies the charges.

She was bailed until April 25.
