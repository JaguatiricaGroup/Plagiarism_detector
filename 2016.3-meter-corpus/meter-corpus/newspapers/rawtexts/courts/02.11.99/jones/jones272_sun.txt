SOUTHAMPTON football club manager David Jones appeared in court yesterday on ten child abuse charges.

Jones, 43, a former Everton defender, denied four charges of indecent assault and six of cruelty while he worked at a Merseyside boys' home between 1987 and 1990.

Father-of-four Jones was remanded on bail by Dale Street magistrates, Liverpool.

The case follows allegations by four former residents at the home during an ongoing police investigation codenamed "Operation Care".
