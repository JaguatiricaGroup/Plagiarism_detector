A man who sued the Metropolitan Police over racist incidents was awarded £40,050 damages at the High Court in London yesterday.

The jury found that Mark Price, 36, a community worker of Nunhead, south-east London, had proved that he was detained against his will on four occasions. He suffered post-traumatic stress disorder.
