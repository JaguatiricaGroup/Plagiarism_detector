A man who raped and stabbed to death a former schoolfriend of his wife and then tried to cut up her body before dumping it in a wheelie bin was jailed for life at Teesside crown court yesterday.

Graham Wilson, 25, of Grangetown, Middlesbrough, had admitted murdering Amanda Jane Fulcher, 21, a waitress, after persuading her to go to the house of a friend, Steven Staton, 20, who was jailed for six years for helping dispose of the body.
