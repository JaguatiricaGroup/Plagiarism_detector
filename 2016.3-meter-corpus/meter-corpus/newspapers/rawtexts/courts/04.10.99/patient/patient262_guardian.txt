A retired miner was killed by being given a "massive overdose" of morphine, Teesside crown court heard yesterday.

A nurse gave 30 times the safe dose to Billy Brettwood, 77, at Seaton View nursing home in Seaham, Co Durham. Nursing staff and a GP failed to take appropriate action. Maureen Usher, 66, Vicky Haswell, 25, Jane Gustafsson, 48, and Michelle Wilson, 36, all deny manslaughter.
