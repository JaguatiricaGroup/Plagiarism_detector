DEAF and dumb Paul Gorman put a balaclava on AFTER entering the takeaway he planned to rob. Gormless Irishman Gorman, 33, made frantic "give me the money" gestures but was ignored by staff until he brandished a knife.

When they finally called police he meekly waited to be arrested outside the Perfect Fried Chicken bar in Hackney, east London. Gorman, from Hackney, got a one year suspended jail sentence at a London court yesterday.
