A DEAF mute armed robber's gestures failed to have the desired impact when he held up a fast-food takeaway, South-wark Crown Court heard yesterday.

Staff at Perfect Fried Chicken, in Hackney, east London, initially thought it was a joke and ignored balaclava-clad Paul Gorman. It was only when he began brandishing a knife and pointing to the till, that they decided to call the police.

Gorman, 33, who admitted the offence, had been desperate for money to visit his ailing mother in Ireland.

Judge George Bathurst-Norman gave him a one-year suspended sentence but warned that next time a court would not be so lenient.
