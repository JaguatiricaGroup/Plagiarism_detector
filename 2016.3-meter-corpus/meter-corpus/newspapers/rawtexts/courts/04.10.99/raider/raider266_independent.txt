A DEAF and dumb man who attempted to hold up a restaurant while carrying a knife was spared a jail sentence yesterday when a judge took pity on him because of his disabilities.

Staff at the fast-food shop initially dismissed Paul Gorman's robbery attempt as a joke when he entered the premises and put on a mask, London Southwark Crown Court heard. But they realised the seriousness of the situation when Gorman brandished a kitchen knife, using "finger gestures" to indicate that they should empty the till. Staff at Perfect Fried Chicken in Hackney, east London, then called the police.

Gorman, 33, realised this and removed his disguise before waiting for the police to arrive, the court was told. Melanie Simpson, defending, said the attempted robbery last January had been a "desperate" bid by her penniless client to bankroll a trip to Co Meath in Ireland to see his ailing mother.

Judge George Bathurst-Norman told Gorman, of Gascoyne Estate, Hackney, that even though he had admitted the offence, he would normally have been jailed. But because of Gorman's disabilities, Judge Bathurst-Norman said that he felt able to suspend for two years the one-year sentence.
