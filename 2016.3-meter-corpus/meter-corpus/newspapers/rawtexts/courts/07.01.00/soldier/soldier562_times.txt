A company sergeant major accused of racially abusing a black soldier was cleared of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline. CSM Michael Gleave, 39, had denied making racist remarks to or about Private Roy Carr, and two charges of ill-treatment, during a tour of duty in Ulster in 1998 with the 1st Battalion The Queen's Lancashire Regiment. Carr, now a lance-corporal in the Army Air Corps, said the CSM had referred to him as 'coon' and 'nigger'.
