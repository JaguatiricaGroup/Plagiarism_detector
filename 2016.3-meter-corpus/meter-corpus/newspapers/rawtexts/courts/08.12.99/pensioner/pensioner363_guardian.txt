Two men were yesterday jailed for life for murdering Hilda Tizzard, 88, by leaving her with a T-shirt tied round her neck at her sheltered home in Bognor in West Sussex, after stealing £33.

Patrick Rattigan, 22, and Terence Wyatt, 28, both of Littlehampton and students at the time, had denied murder but were found guilty by a jury at Lewes crown court.
