A DRUNK driver who ploughed into the Queen Mother's limo was fined £700 and banned for two years yesterday.

Eamon Reidy, 32, was 2½ times over the legal limit when he rammed the parked Daimler in a country lane. The Queen Mum - 99 last week - was not in the car at the time but her chauffeur was.

Airport worker Reid sped off after the smash near Egham, Surrey, on July 4. He glanced off a wall and flattened some bushes before abandoning his Citroen.

Chased

Then he ran 1½ miles across fields chased by crash witness John Horton. Mr Horton finally cornered, him - but Reidy threatened him and fled. Reidy, of Langley, Berks, tried to hide in some undergrowth. But he was spotted by a police helicopter and arrested, magistrates in Woking, Surrey, heard.

Defending, Lesley Barry said Reidy was trying to buy a house and had money worries. He had drunk two glasses of champagne at his parents' wedding anniversary party before drinking three pints of strong lager at a pub.
