A BOOZY driver who smashed into the Queen Mum's chauffeur-driven Daimler minutes after she had been dropped off was banned for two years and fined £700 yesterday.

Eamon Reidy, 32, fled across fields in Windsor Great Park after the crash, the court heard. Grandad John Horton, 56, head gardener on the royal estate, chased him in his slippers for one and a half miles as armed cops, dogs and helicopter joined in the pursuit. John caught up with the fugitive and grabbed his arm. But when Reidy threatened him - "he decided discretion was the better part of valour and let him go," Woking magistrates were told.

Police discovered airport worker Reidy lying in undergrowth near the Queen Mum's Royal Lodge on the Crown estate. He was found to be two-and-a-half times over the legal limit. Reidy, of Langley, Berks, admitted drink- driving and failing to stop.
