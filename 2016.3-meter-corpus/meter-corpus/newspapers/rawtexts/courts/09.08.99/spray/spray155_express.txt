A POLICEMAN wept with relief last night after being cleared of assaulting a colleague and two others with CS gas spray while breaking up a fight.

WPC Deborah Davidson, 30, had claimed PC Andrew Bateson, 28, had "overreacted" when helping her deal with a fracas in Bolton in November 1997, spraying her and two others in the face.

She said she had calmed the situation but PC Bateson said he feared for her safety. A jury at Manchester Crown Court cleared him of three charges of assault.
