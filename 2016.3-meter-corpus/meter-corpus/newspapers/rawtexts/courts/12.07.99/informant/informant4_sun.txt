A CROWN Prosecution Service clerk tipped off mobsters about witnesses who had grassed on them, a court heard yesterday.

Mark Herbert, 31, betrayed the identities of 33 vital informants for £1,000, it is claimed.

He also divulged secret details of police probes into the notorious Adams Family gang, a jury heard. Prosecutor Victor Temple QC said policeman's son Herbert, who earned £14,000 a year at the CPS's London HQ, gave the grasses' names to gangland go-between Kevin Sumer, 41. The pair met at Options nightclub, in Kingston, Surrey, where Herbert, of nearby Twickenham, was moonlighting as a bouncer.

It is claimed Sumer, of Brentford, passed on information to Billy Isaacs, a top member of the Adams gang. Lists of witnesses' names were found in Sumer's Land Rover Discovery, the jury heard. Mr Temple told Luton Crown Court: "It needs little imagination to anticipate what might occur if Informants' names were to fall into the wrong hands."

When arrested, Herbert is said to have told cops: "I was trying to make some easy money." At the time, gang boss Tommy Adams faced drug charges. He was later jailed for 7½ years.

Herbert and Sumer deny corruption and conspiracy to pervert justice. The trial goes on.
