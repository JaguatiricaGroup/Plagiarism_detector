A battle for compensation by an English couple who claimed they were victims of racial discrimination while living in a Scottish village ended yesterday when lawyers reached an out-of-court settlement. Frank Walters, 52, and his wife Sandra, 53, said they had been vindicated with the undisclosed settlement, believed to be in the region £4,000 plus costs estimated at £40,000.

The settlement, at Dumfries sheriff court, admits no liability on the part of publican Colin Pearson and his wife Jacqueline, a postmistress.
