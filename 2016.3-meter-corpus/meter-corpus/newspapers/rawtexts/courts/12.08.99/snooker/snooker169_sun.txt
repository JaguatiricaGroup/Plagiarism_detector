THE Metropolitan Police faced a new race storm last night after a black WPC was cleared of assaulting a white sergeant with a snooker cue.

Joy Hendricks, 35, who claims she suffered five years of racist abuse, wept as a court accepted she acted in self-defence.

She claimed the row flared after Sgt Mark Workman, 36, made a jibe about murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. Joy said afterwards: "This is going to open a can of worms."
