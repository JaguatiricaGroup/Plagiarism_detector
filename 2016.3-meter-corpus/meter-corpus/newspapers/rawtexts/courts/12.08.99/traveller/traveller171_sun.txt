A new age traveller yesterday lost his £500,000 damages claim against a woman who ran him over and cost him a leg. Roger Gedge 30, was part of a drunken gang who menaced mum Sarah Field, 27, at a Nottingham festival in 1994. He lay in front of her car. But she sped off unaware he was there and crushed his legs. One was later amputated.

A Nottingham County Court judge said the men terrified Sarah, adding "What Gedge did was beyond comprehension."
