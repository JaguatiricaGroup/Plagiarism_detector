A New Age traveller yesterday lost a claim for compensation against a driver who crushed him as he lay in front of her car while his friends attacked her. Roger Gedge, 30, of Arnold, Nottingham, lost a leg and suffered other injuries in the incident in July 1994. He claimed the driver of the car, Sarah Field, 27, from Cheltenham, had been negligent and unreasonable.
