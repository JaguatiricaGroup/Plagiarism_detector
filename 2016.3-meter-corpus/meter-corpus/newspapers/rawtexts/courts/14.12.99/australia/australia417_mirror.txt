THE man who turned his ex-girlfriend into a human fireball has changed his court plea AGAIN and today faces a 25-year jail sentence.

Stephen Rae, 34, from Perthshire, had tried to alter his admission of causing malicious harm.

But yesterday he dropped the challenge and will be sentenced in Sydney today for the petrol attack on London nurse Gabriella Mazzali, 28.
