FORMER Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning was jailed for four-and-a-half years yesterday for having sex with under-age boys.

A Prague court was told that Denning, 59, was the head of an international paedophile ring preying on boys as young as 10 then filming their crimes. Denning, who helped launch the Bay City Rollers to stardom, admitted having sex with three Czech boys. He said he had thought they were over the age of consent.
