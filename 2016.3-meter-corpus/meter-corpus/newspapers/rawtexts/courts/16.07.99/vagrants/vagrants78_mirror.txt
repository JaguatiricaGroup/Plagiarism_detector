AN innocent woman jailed for life 10 years ago for a double murder walked free from the Appeal Court yesterday. Former nurse Mary Druhan, 55, was arrested after a fire killed two men at a squat in Kingston upon Thames she shared with other alcoholics. Men at the squat accused her. One was later linked  with fires, in one of which a woman died.

Mrs Druhan, whose conviction was  quashed as unsafe, had her first appeal thrown out in 1990.
