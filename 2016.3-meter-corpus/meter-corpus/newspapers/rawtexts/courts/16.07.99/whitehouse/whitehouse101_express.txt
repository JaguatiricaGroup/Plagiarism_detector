CHIEF constable's daughter Frances Whitehouse assaulted two policemen after drinking a litre of cider, a court heard yesterday.

Whitehouse, 18, of Hove, Sussex, swore at one and kicked another during a row with her boyfriend.

She was ordered to do 150 hours' community service and pay the injured PC £400 compensation.
