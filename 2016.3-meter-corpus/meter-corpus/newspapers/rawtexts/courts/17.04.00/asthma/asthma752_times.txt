A NURSE was awarded a record £157,000 damages yesterday after the chemical she used to sterilise instruments made her ill.

Fostina Brobbey, 58, developed occupational asthma in 1995 after exposure to the sterilising chemical, Cidex, which is known to cause breathing difficulties and skin complaints if it is not handled properly.

The award is the largest ever for occupational asthma. Previous payouts have ranged from £5,000 to £120,000. Mrs Brobbey, who has five children, welcomed the ruling at Manchester County Court, but said that she would prefer to have her job back.

Her award could open the floodgates for a spate of claims from nurses who believe they may have symptoms caused by the chemical. Judith Gledhill, Mrs Brobbey's solicitor, who is working on four similar cases, said: 'As a firm we anticipate we could soon be dealing with hundreds more claims from nurses.'

Mrs Brobbey was working at North Manchester General Hospital when she developed asthma in 1995. She retired in September 1996 due to ill health. Nick Grimshaw, of North Manchester Healthcare NHS Trust, said it had made efforts to limit the use of the chemical wherever possible.
