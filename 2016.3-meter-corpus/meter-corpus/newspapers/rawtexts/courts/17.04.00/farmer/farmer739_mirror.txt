FARMER Tony Martin acted as 'judge, jury, and executioner', when he shot dead teenage burglar Fred Barras, a court heard yesterday.

The 55-year-old owned a Winchester pump-action shotgun to 'shoot any intruder who had the temerity to come on to his property', said Rosamund Horwood-Smart, QC, prosecuting.

But defence barrister Anthony Scrivener, QC, insisted Martin had been 'a victim of crime'.

The two lawyers were making their closing speeches in the trial of bachelor Martin who denies murdering 16-year-old Barras, of Newark, Notts, and attempting to murder accomplice Brendan Fearon, 30.

Mr Scrivener told Norwich Crown Court: He didn't want burglars in his house. He was put into a situation where he had to make some desperate decisions.

'A wrong decision on his part could lead him to suffer serious injury or even death.'

He said that the prosecution had suggested Martin, of Bleak House, Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, had behaved like a sheriff and lured Barras and Fearon into his remote farmhouse 'like rats in a trap'.

But he added: 'How could he have known these burglars would come to his home on this night?'

The jury is expected to start considering its verdict today.
