FARMER Tony Martin acted as judge, jury and executioner, when he shot dead a teenager who was burgling his home, a court heard yesterday.

Miss Rosamund Horwood-Smart, QC, prosecuting, made the remarks in her closing speech in the trial of bachelor Martin, 55, who denies murdering Fred Barras, 16. But Anthony Scrivener, QC, defending, said Martin had been 'a victim of crime'.

The jury is expected to retire today.
