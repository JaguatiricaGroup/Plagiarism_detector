TONY Martin acted as 'jury, judge and executioner' when he shot and killed a 16-year-old burglar in his remote farmhouse one night last August, Norwich Crown Court was told yesterday.

In her closing speech, Rosamund Horwood-Smart, QC, prosecuting, added that all the evidence pointed to Martin, 55, laying in wait for Fred Barras and Brendan Fearon, 30, to break into his dilapidated home in Emneth, Norfolk, after being awoken by his dogs barking.

She said: 'This was a man who was angry, who was shooting to kill.'

Anthony Scrivener, QC, defending, said that on Aug 20 last year, Martin had been forced to make desperate decisions. 'The wrong decision could lead him to suffer serious injury or death.'

The case continues.
