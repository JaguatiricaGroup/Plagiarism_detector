A farmer accused of murdering a teenage burglar was a 'man who was prepared to be a police force, investigating force, jury judge and if necessary executioner', a court was told yesterday. 

A jury of six men and six women was told by the prosecution that the killing of Fred Barras, 16, at an isolated farmhouse last August, was not self-defence but murder by 'a man willing to take the law into his own hands'. 

Tony Martin, 55, is accused of killing Mr Barras, a market trader from Newark, Nottinghamshire, during a late night bungled burglary. Mr Barras had entered Martin's property near Emneth, Norfolk. Martin is also accused of attempting to murder, and unlawfully wounding, Brendon Fearon, 30, with intent to do him grievous bodily harm. 

He denies the charges, and another charge of possessing a firearm and ammunition with intent to injure life, but has pleaded guilty to the possession of a Winchester pump-action shotgun without a firearms certificate.

In her closing statement, Rosamund Horwood-Smart QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Martin lay in wait for the burglars and shot them like 'rats in a trap'.

She told Norwich crown court: 'Mr Martin was a man that knew the power, force, and damage that a shotgun can inflict. He had that gun for one particular reason. He had that gun to use, if and when the occasion arose ... to shoot any intruder who had the temerity to come in to his property, in to his home; on to his land.'

Anthony Scrivener QC, defending, said Martin was a victim of crime who was acting in self-defence. He said the farmer had suffered a number of burglaries and had been visited by a 'number of dangerous people' over the years. 'He didn't want people to burgle his house. He was in a situation where he had to make some desperate decisions.' 

The hearing continues.
