SUPERGRASSES have no legal right to claim payment from the police, a judge ruled yesterday.

The ruling came in a case in which an informant, Keith Robinson, sued the Customs and Excise service, accusing it of short-changing him on payment. He claimed he had received £9,150 and sued for £33,574. He was owed the money as a 'reasonable remuneration arising out of his services', he claimed. 

Mr Justice Douglas Brown granted an application by Customs and Excise and struck out Robinson's claim. He said he did not consider it had any reasonable prospect of succeeding. Robinson, who ran a vehicle repair business at Leighton Buzzard, Beds, said he had been approached by a customer who had asked if he was interested in smuggling. He told the Customs and Excise about the approach and as a result they intercepted a van containing three quarters of a ton of cannabis brought into the country through Dover.

Robinson claimed he was told he would be paid £10,000 for the information leading to that arrest but received only £6,500. He claims he continued to provide information to the Customs and Excise and that he had a legally enforceable contract. But the judge said Customs and Excise had satisfied him that there had been no intention by either party to create legal relations between them.

He added: 'I would also hold that an informant cannot maintain a claim against the Commissioners of Customs and Excise or a chief officer of police in respect of any reward for information.'
