A DRUGGED blonde who woke to find a male nurse having sex with her was told by her attacker: 'Don't worry, you won't remember this,' the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

The woman, a 33-year-old hospital patient, wept as she told a jury how 'everything went black' after Kevin Cobb gave her an injection. She said: 'I remember coming round and realising something was wrong. My legs were in the air and apart, and he had his hands inside me. I thought, 'He is abusing me.' He was quite sweaty and had a sarcastic grin.'

The woman, who had sought treatment for stomach pains, added: 'He seemed surprised I was conscious, but he still carried on. Next thing, I remember him doing up his trousers. When I asked why he was having sex with me, he said, 'Oh you remember that, do you? Well don't worry - you won't later.' I recall saying, 'Yes, I will remember it'.'

Cobb, 38, of Yateley, Hants, who worked at St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, is accused of drugging and assaulting four women, including nursing sister Susan Annis, 31, who died from drug effects.

He denies 11 charges, including manslaughter, rape and administering the drug Midazolam. 

The trial goes on.
