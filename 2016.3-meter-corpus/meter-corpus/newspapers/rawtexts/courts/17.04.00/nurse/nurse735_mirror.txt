A WOMAN wept yesterday as she told a court how she woke up in hospital and saw a male nurse raping her.

The 33 year old said that Kevin Cobb was naked from the waist down. She told an Old Bailey jury she blacked out after an injection and found she was unable to move. She said: 'I could see what was happening but I could not feel it. I could not at that point speak. He looked rather shocked to see me looking at him but he still carried on.'

Cobb, 38, who is married to a GP, is accused of drugging women with an anaesthetic to rape or sexually assault them. The IT sales consultant said that she blacked out again after realising she was being assaulted.

When she awoke she asked Cobb: 'What were you doing? Why were you having sex with me?' She added: 'He kind of shrugged his shoulders and said 'Oh you remember that, do you? Well, don't worry, you won't remember that later'. 'I thought 'Yes, I will remember'.' She had been taken to St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, with abdominal pains.

Cobb, of Yateley, Hants, denies 11 charges including rape and the manslaughter of a nursing sister who died from a drug reaction.

The trial continues.
