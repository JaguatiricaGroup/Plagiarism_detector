A WOMAN wept yesterday as she told a court how she woke up in hospital and saw a male nurse raping her.

The 33-year-old recalled that Kevin Cobb was naked from the waist down. She told an Old Bailey jury she blacked out after being given an injection and found she was unable to move.

'I could see what was happening but I could not feel it,' she said. 'I could not at that point speak. He looked rather shocked to see me looking at him but he still carried on.' 

Cobb, 38, who worked In the accident and emergency department of St Peter's Hospital at Chertsey, Surrey, and is married to a GP, is accused of drugging women with an anaesthetic in order to rape or sexually assault them.

The 33-year-old IT sales consultant was taken to the hospital in January last year with severe abdominal pains.

The court heard that she blacked out again after realising she was being assaulted and when she came to Cobb had his back to her. She had told him: 'What were you doing? Why were you having sex with me?'

The woman added: 'He turned round and kind of shrugged his shoulders and said ' you remember that do you?' Well, don't worry, you won't remember that later.' When he said those words, I thought 'Yes, I will remember.'

Cobb, from Yateley, Hampshire, denies 11 charges including rape and the manslaughter of a nursing sister who died from a drug reaction. 

The trial continues.
