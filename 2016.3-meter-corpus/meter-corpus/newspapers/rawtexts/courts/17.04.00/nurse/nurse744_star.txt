A WOMAN broke down in tears as she told a jury how she woke up in hospital to find a male nurse having sex with her. The 33-year-old said she passed out and came round to find her legs in the air and nurse Kevin Cobb, 38, on top of her.

She told the Old Bailey that she had blacked out after he gave her an injection in St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey.

The woman sobbed: 'I could see what was happening but I could not feel it. I could not speak. He looked rather shocked to see me looking at him but he still carried on.' She passed out again and when she asked why he was having sex with her she said he replied: 'Oh you remember that do you? Well, don't worry, you won't remember later'.

Cobb, of Yateley, Hants, denies drugging 11 women to rape or sexually assault them and the manslaughter of junior sister Susan Annis, 31. 

The trial continues.
