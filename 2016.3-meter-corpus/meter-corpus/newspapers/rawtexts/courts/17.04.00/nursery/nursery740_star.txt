CRUEL nursery boss Gloria Price put children through three years of abuse and terror, a court heard yesterday.

Price, 58, targeted children from poor families in particular for ill-treatment, the jury heard. 'She hated parents on social benefits,' said prosecutor David Aubrey. 'It was a class thing with her,' he told Merthyr Crown Court, South Wales.

Mr Aubrey said at first Play Time Nursery in Brecon was properly run, but as time went by Price was seen to inflict or tolerate a catalogue of cruelty. Children were often picked up by one arm, swung and dropped on the floor. One was tied to a chair for being naughty for 'a substantial amount of time'. Tots from the age of 12 months who would not eat were allegedly force-fed, making them gag and vomit. 

'Another child was struck on the head with a hard book until it cried with distress.'

Staff described her as 'a real tyrant' who 'frightened both the children and the employees'. Price, of Felin Fach, Brecon, Powys, denies 14 charges of cruelty to six boys and girls between November 1995 and March 1999.
