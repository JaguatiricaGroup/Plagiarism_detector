The owner of a nursery tied a three-year-old child to a chair with a scarf because he would not sit down and force fed other children until they were physically sick, a court was told yesterday.

Margaret Gloria Price, 58, who did not have any child care qualifications or training when she started the Playtime nursery in Brecon, south Wales, pleaded not guilty to 14 charges of child cruelty at Merthyr crown court.

It is alleged that Price was cruel towards several children, some as young as 12 months, in her care between November 1995 and March 1999.

The court was told that Price hit a young boy over the back of the head with a hard book because he would not listen to a story she was reading and forced a little girl to bite her own hand.

The jury, of seven men and five women, heard that in another incident she told a three-year-old boy: 'You are like a fat, lazy pudding that doesn't taste very nice' because he could not say his alphabet.

David Aubrey QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'The initial facilities [at the nursery] were regarded as good. But the reality altered as time went by. We are talking about the deliberate, criminal ill-treatment of these children.' He said that her staff had described her as a 'tyrant', a 'bully' and said that she had created a 'culture of fear in the nursery'.

He told the court that Price had targeted particular children because she disliked their parents.

The case continues.
