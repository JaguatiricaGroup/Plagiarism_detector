THE OWNER of a children's nursery tied a three-year-old boy to a chair with a scarf because he would not sit down and force-fed other children until they were sick, a court heard yesterday.

Margaret Gloria Price, 58, who did not have any childcare qualifications or training when she started the Playtime nursery in Brecon, South Wales, pleaded not guilty to 14 charges of child cruelty; at Merthyr Crown Court.

It is alleged that Mrs Price, who is the wife of a solicitor in the town, was cruel towards several children, some as young as 12 months, in her care between November 1995 and March 1999. Mrs Price is alleged to have hit a boy over the back of the head with a book because he would not listen to a story she was reading, and to have forced a girl to bite her own hand.

The jury of seven men and five women were also told that Mrs Price said to a three-year-old boy: 'You are like a fat, lazy pudding that doesn't taste very nice,' because he could not say his alphabet.

David Aubrey, for the prosecution, told the court: 'We are talking about the deliberate, criminal ill-treatment of these children.' He added that staff who worked for Mrs Price had described her as a 'tyrant' and 'bully' and said she had created a 'culture of fear in the nursery'.

The case continues.
