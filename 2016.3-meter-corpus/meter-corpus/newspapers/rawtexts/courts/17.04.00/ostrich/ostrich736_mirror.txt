A MUM-of-three who stole £275,000 from investors in an ostrich farm scam walked free from court yesterday after being ordered to pay compensation of just £1.

Esther Marie Evans, 36, and her husband Martin duped more than 100 people into parting with their cash by claiming they could make a fortune from ostrich meat.
But after they had fleeced £850,000 off unsuspecting investors the couple suddenly closed down the business in Swansea. More than a £300,000 was funnelled through bank accounts in the Channel Islands and the Bahamas before being withdrawn in cash.

Investors never saw their cash again, Swansea Crown Court heard. Evans was convicted of fraudulent trading and theft.

She was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and told to pay the £1 compensation after the court heard her husband had fled the country and left her penniless.

Police are still hunting Martin, 38, who has had a string of affairs behind his wife's back.
