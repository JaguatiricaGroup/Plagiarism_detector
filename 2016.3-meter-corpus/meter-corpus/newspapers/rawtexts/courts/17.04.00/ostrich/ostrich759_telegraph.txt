A BUSINESSWOMAN who stole £275,000 from investors in her ostrich farm was given a two-year suspended jail sentence yesterday.

Esther Evans was also banned from being involved in a company for 10 years after being found guilty of four charges of theft and one count of fraudulent trading.

Judge Michael Burr told Swansea Crown Court that the ostrich farm, set up in Dunvant, near Swansea, in 1995 was a dishonest scheme to get money from investors. He told Evans, 36, of Uplands, Swansea, that she was 'not the innocent dupe you invited the jury to accept you were', but added that she had been manipulated by her husband, Martin.

Martin Evans, 38, was due to stand trial on similar charges, but did not turn up for the start of the hearing and has not been seen since. 

During the two-week trial, the court heard that the couple set up the ostrich-breeding farm after Martin Evans was released from prison following a sentence for obtaining property by deception. They placed adverts in national newspapers under the slogan Ostrich Nest Egg, and 115 people, including the former ITN newsreader Fiona Armstrong, invested a total of £875,000 before the business was declared insolvent in July 1996.
