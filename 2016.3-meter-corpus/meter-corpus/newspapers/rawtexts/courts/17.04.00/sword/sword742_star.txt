THE man accused of the Samurai sword killing of councillor Andrew Pennington and attempted murder of MP Nigel Jones is bidding to have his trial venue switched. Divorced father-of-two

Rob Ashman, 49, is alleged to have attacked Mr Pennington, 39, and Mr Jones, 51, at the Liberal-Democrat offices in Cheltenham in January. Bristol Crown Court was told yesterday he wants his November trial moved because he fears he won't get a fair hearing locally.
