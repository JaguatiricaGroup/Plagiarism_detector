A RESEARCHER accused of arranging for fake guests to appear on the BBC's Vanessa show yesterday accepted 'large' libel damages in the High Court.

Deborah Price, 25, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, who is now a researcher on Blind Date, also received a public apology over an article published in The Mirror in February last year concerning the show hosted by Vanessa Feltz. The court in London was told that article alleged that not only were the guests fakes, but that Miss Price had known they were fakes and had deliberately deceived her employers and the viewers of the show.

But the truth was that she neither knew nor suspected that any of the guests were faked - and had taken reasonable steps to verify their authenticity, 'bearing in mind the time constraints imposed on her' by the BBC, the court heard.

MGN Ltd, publisher of The Mirror, accepted there was no truth in the allegation that Miss Price knew the guests were fakes.
