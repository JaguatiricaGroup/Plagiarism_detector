A FORMER researcher on the now-defunct television talkshow Vanessa has accepted a 'large' libel payment from The Mirror after it claimed that she knew the programme was using bogus guests.

Deborah Price, 25, now a researcher on Cilla Black's ITV show Blind Date, also received a public apology in the High Court in London yesterday. The BBC axed Vanessa last summer after The Mirror revealed that some of the show's guests were actors or strippagrams posing as people with personal problems.

David Price, Ms Price's lawyer, told Mr Justice Eady that she had not suspected the three fakes and had taken reasonable steps to verify their stories in the time she had. The fakes had since admitted deceiving Ms Price and said they had no reason to believe she knew they were bogus, he added. The Mirror now accepts that Ms Price did not know the guests were bogus.
