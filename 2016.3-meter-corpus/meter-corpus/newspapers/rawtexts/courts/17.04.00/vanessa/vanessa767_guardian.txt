A television researcher accused of arranging for fake guests to appear on the BBC's Vanessa show accepted 'large' libel damages in the high court in London yesterday.

Deborah Price, 25, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, who is now a researcher on Cilla Black's Blind Date show, also received a public apology over an article in the Mirror newspaper in February last year concerning the show presented by Vanessa Feltz.

Ms Price's solicitor, David Price, told Mr Justice Eady that the article 'disclosed that several guests who had appeared on the show purporting to relate true-life stories were in fact fakes who had invented the accounts which they presented to viewers'.

One show featured a woman who said she wanted a divorce when she was not married, he said. 'Another concerned two women who claimed they were sisters but were in fact unrelated.'

Ms Price had arranged for the guests to appear on the show, he said.

'The article went on to allege that not only were the guests fakes, but also that Ms Price had known that they were fakes and had thereby deliberately deceived her employers and the viewers.'

But Ms Price neither knew nor suspected that any of the guests were fakes. She took reasonable steps to verify their authenticity, 'bearing in mind the time constraints imposed on her by her employers, the BBC' Mr Price said.

'The three fake guests all admitted that they had sought to deceive Ms Price into believing they were genuine, and stated that they had no reason to believe that Ms Price was aware that they were fakes.' She was 'devastated' by the article.

The defendant, MGN Ltd, publisher of the Mirror, now accepted that there was no truth in the allegation that she knew the guests were fakes.

The judge was told that Ms Price, who also received her legal costs, hoped she could now pursue a career in television production 'without a stain on her reputation.'
