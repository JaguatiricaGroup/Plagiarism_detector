A DEALER in Britain's biggest-ever car clocking fraud was jailed yesterday for 18 months.

Crooked Andrew Hawkins, 42, set back milometers on 363 used cars that he sold. Each lost about 35,000 miles. The missing 12.7million miles would stretch to the moon and back 25 times.

Hawkins ran AH Motors in Winterbourne, Gloucester. He was ordered to pay £20,000 towards prosecution costs by the Exeter court.
