A CROOKED car dealer clocked so many cars the missing 12.7 million miles would stretch to the moon and back 25 times. 

Andrew Hawkins wound back the odometer on 363 cars which passed through his garage near Bristol, in what Exeter Crown Court heard was Britain's biggest ever docking fraud. Hawkins is thought to have taken around 35,000 miles off each of the cars he bought in South Wales before selling them on.

He was caught when trading standards officers traced a docked car which was bought off a forecourt in Paignton, South Devon.

Martin Meeke, prosecuting, said: 'Trading Standards investigated his records and found a total of 427 had been put through the MOT test by him. 'They contacted former owners and 45 out of 53 said the cars had higher mileages when sold.' Hawkins, 42, from Bristol, admitted 14 specimen counts under the Trade Descriptions Act. He was Jailed for 18 months and ordered to pay £20,000 prosecution costs.
