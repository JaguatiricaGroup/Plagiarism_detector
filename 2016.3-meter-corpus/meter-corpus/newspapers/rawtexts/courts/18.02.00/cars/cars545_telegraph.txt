A CAR dealer who 'clocked' more than 12 million miles off hundreds of secondhand cars was jailed for 18 months yesterday.

Andrew Hawkins, 42, of Ham Farm Lane, Bristol, admitted 14 specimen charges under trading standards laws, but Exeter Crown court was told that he had altered the odometers on hundreds of cars in Britain's worst car clocking case.

He bought the vehicles cheaply in South Wales, then sold them on himself or through other dealers in the West Country.

Hawkins was said to have reduced the vehicle's recorded mileage by an average of 35,000 miles, adding about £900 to the value of each car - making a profit in excess of £300,000.

He was ordered to pay £20,000 costs.
