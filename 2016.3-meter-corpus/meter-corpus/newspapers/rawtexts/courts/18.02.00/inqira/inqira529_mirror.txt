AN IRA terrorist shot dead during a police raid was killed lawfully, an inquest jury ruled yesterday.

Diarmuid O'Neill, 27, was hit by six bullets from an automatic rifle when armed police firing CS gas burst into a hotel room where he and two accomplices were staying. It followed a three month surveillance operation which linked them to six tons of explosives found hidden in London.

O'Neill's father Eoghan and mother Terry sat at the back of the hearing in Kingston-upon-Thames as the verdict was given. Mr O'Neill said later he was considering an appeal and called for a public Inquiry to 'Investigate all recent fatal shootings by armed police'.

He added: 'I'm disappointed with the verdict. We wanted Justice. The police have got away lightly - they were deaf, blind and dumb. They should never have gone in there with the gas. My son would still be alive if they hadn't.'

Scotland Yard's anti-terror chief Alan Fry said: 'The verdict supports the actions by officers faced with terrorists who were planning to bomb London and had access to explosives and firearms.'

In Ulster Sinn Fein spokesman Gerry Kelly said It would 'not come as any surprise to anyone'. He added: 'There is no expectation that Irish people can achieve justice in British courts.'
