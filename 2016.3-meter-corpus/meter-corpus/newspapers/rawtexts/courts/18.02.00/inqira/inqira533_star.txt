A SUSPECTED IRA terrorist shot dead during a police raid was killed lawfully, an inquest jury ruled yesterday.

Unarmed Diarmuid O'Neill, 27, was hit six times with shots from an automatic rifle.

Armed police burst into a room in a west London hotel in September 1996 after a three-month surveillance operation targeted O'Neill and his accomplices. They had amassed six tons of home-made explosives in a London hideaway.

A jury at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court took four hours to reach a majority verdict.
