DIARMUID O'NEILL, a suspected IRA terrorist, was lawfully killed when he was shot dead in a London hotel room during a bungled police raid, an inquest jury in Kingston upon Thames decided yesterday.

The unarmed O'Neill, 27, died when he was hit six times by automatic rifle fire in 1996 when police burst in to his room after a surveillance operation.

The coroner's jury took four hours to reach a majority verdict over the killing of the IRA man, who was staying at the hotel with two other suspected terrorists. Anti-terrorist police had targeted O'Neill and his group after a number of explosions, including one at Canary Wharf in London.

During a three-week hearing, Michael Mansfield, QC, representing the family, told the jury how police had made a 'catalogue of errors', but the policeman, identified only as Officer Kilo, who fired the fatal shots told the inquest that he feared O'Neill was holding a gun and that his life was in danger.

Last night Gerry Kelly, himself a former London bomber and now Sinn Fein's policing spokesman, condemned the verdict. 'There is no expectation that Irish people, alive or dead, can achieve justice in British courts,' he said.
