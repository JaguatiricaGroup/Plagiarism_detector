ROYAL footman Anthony Willis escaped with 12 months' probation yesterday despite threatening to kill his ex-lover when she began an affair with another Buckingham Palace servant.

The 47-year-old senior page vowed to attack Lynn Freeman, 22, with a hammer after he learned her new boyfriend lived in the next room below stairs. Willis, who had waited on the Queen for 25 years, could not stand the thought of her in bed with another man. And in a late-night phone call to Miss Freeman, a clerk who looked after Royal Household bills, he said: 'I'm going to hit you on the back of your head with a hammer and I don't care if I go to prison. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I won't be happy until you are dead.'

But despite Willis admitting the threats, he won mercy after Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court heard a reference from his former Palace employers.

Judge Henry Blacksell told him: 'You represent no continuing threat.'

Willis's romance with Miss Freeman began in April 1998. But after it ended next January he learned she was dating servant Paul Chatterton.

He tried to commit suicide and was admitted to a mental hospital last May.

He was arrested in October ... telling police: 'She's ruined my life and she's got to pay'.

Outside court Willis, now of Great Houghton, Barnsley, South Yorks, said he was going to live in a religious retreat in Dorset.
