A FORMER television presenter found unconscious at the wheel of her car was so drunk that officers had to throw water in her face to revive her, a court heard yesterday. Philippa Gant, 31, a journalist formerly with MUTV and L!ve TV, was more than five times the legal drink-drive limit when she was arrested on the afternoon of last Christmas Eve, Crewe magistrates were told.

Gant, of Barnes, south-west London, was committed for sentence after pleading guilty to drink-driving and dangerous driving on the M6 in Cheshire.

Jane Large, prosecuting, said Gant was arrested after her Audi Coupe was seen meandering across all three lanes of the motorway.

Anthony Barnfather, defending, said the effects of alcohol on Gant may have been worsened by betablockers. She had been unemployed since July last year, after her TV career was cut short following a panic attack live on air.
