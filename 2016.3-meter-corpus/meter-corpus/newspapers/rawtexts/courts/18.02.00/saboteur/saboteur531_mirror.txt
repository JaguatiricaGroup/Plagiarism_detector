A HUNT saboteur injured by a hunt supporter was yesterday stripped of his £52,000 damages award.

Three Appeal judges ruled that the farmer who hit him with a baseball bat acted in self-defence. Their ruling was seen as a warning to other hunt protesters.Lord Justice Beldam said it was 'absurd' to suggest that farmer Bill Kirkby, 56, was criminally responsible for the brain damage suffered by Harry Cross, 47.

The pair clashed at a Lincolnshire hunt in 1992. Cross lost his temper, got the bat from his car and smashed it on the ground, snapping it. Mr Kirkby turned to walk away when Cross hit him twice on the arm, saying: 'You're dead.'

The farmer wrestled the bat from Cross and hit him on the side of the head with the unbroken end in self-defence.

A High Court judge awarded Cross £52,000, but the Appeal judges ruled that he was wrong.
