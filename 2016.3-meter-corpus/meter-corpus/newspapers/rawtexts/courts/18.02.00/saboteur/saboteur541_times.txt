AN AWARD of £52,000 to a hunt saboteur who had brandished a baseball bat at a field sports enthusiast and was struck in self-defence was rescinded by the Court of Appeal yesterday.

Bill Kirkby said last night that he was very pleased at the decision. The incident happened during a meeting of the local Brocklesby Hunt, he said.

Harry Cross 'had the baseball bat at my throat and I just thought: he is threatening to kill me. It appeared to me that he meant business. It was very frightening and that's why I walked away to try to calm the situation.' He was hit on the arm and shoulder by Mr Cross 'who was looking for a fight'. Mr Kirkby grabbed at the bat and hit Mr Cross with a single blow. Mr Cross sustained a fractured skull.

Mr Kirkby, 52, a tenant on Lord Yarborough's estate at Wootton, Lincolnshire, who runs a farm, said: 'I am very relieved.' He had been worrying about raising the money.

Last April the High Court ruled that Mr Kirkby had used excessive force, so could not claim self-defence. Now, Mr Kirkby said, 'true British justice' had prevailed.

Yesterday Lord Justice Judge said Mr Kirkby's action was 'not in revenge, or to teach him a lesson or give him a good hiding'. He said: 'Mr Kirkby got into a fight he did not want.' The trial judge had been wrong too 'weigh too nicely' the degree of force used by Mr Kirkby. 'He could not be expected to measure the violence to be deployed with mathematical precision. It is not fair to stand back and say that was too much force and that was not self-defence.'

The court also ruled that the Legal Aid Board should pay costs and refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.

In a ruling seen by lawyers as a warning to hunt saboteurs, the court said it would be wrong for Mr Cross to receive damages caused by his own illegal action

Mr Cross refused to comment last night.
