A hunt saboteur who won £52,000 damages from farmer who retaliated when attacked with a baseball bat yesterday had the award rescinded.

The court of appeal ruled the farmer, William Kirkby, 55, was acting in self defence when he wrested away the bat and struck Harry Cross, 47, on the side of the head, fracturing his skull. Lord Justice Beldam said that the injury, which has led to Mr Cross having epileptic fits, was a result of his 'criminal and unlawful' acts in attacking Mr Kirkby.

A high court judge sitting in Grimsby last year had ruled Mr Cross was entitled to the damages because Mr Kirkby, of Wootton, North Lincolnshire, had used excessive force, and that the defence of acting in self defence was not open to him.

Lord Justice Beldam said yesterday that the ruling had overlooked the fact Mr Kirkby 'had done what he thought was necessary in the anguish of the moment'. He should not have been expected to measure the violence he meted out with 'mathematical precision' to comply with the law.

Mr Cross, of Halesworth, Suffolk, and his partner were on Mr Kirkby's land in 1992 during a meeting of the Brocklesby Hunt. Mr Kirkby, who had had to give up hunting after a fall from a horse, escorted the partner off his land using 'reasonable force' after she bit him, but Mr Cross, a hunt saboteur for 20 years, threatened to kill him, said Lord Justice Beldam.

Mr Cross punched the farmer on his way to his car nearby, from which he took a baseball bat. The saboteur 'became abusive and threatening' and in a rage smashed the bat. Mr Kirkby was alarmed and tried to walk away, but was hit on his arm and shoulder by Mr Cross, 'who was looking for a fight'. Mr Kirkby grabbed the bat and hit Mr Cross a single blow, which ended the fight. Lord Justice Judge said the court found the blow was 'not in revenge, or to teach him a lesson or give him a good hiding'.
