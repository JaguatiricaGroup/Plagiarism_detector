A MAN assaulted his estranged wife by smearing SHAMPOO on her door handle, it was claimed yesterday.

Colin Slane knew that Heather Brown would suffer an allergic reaction, a court was told. He was also said to have spat in her face and damaged her car by jumping on the roof and bonnet. Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Heather, 33, suffered massive reactions from sweets, perfume and toiletries after sipping a fizzy drink at a club in the city in 1995.

Because of her condition, the hearing was subject to strict controls. Everyone entering the court had to promise that they were not wearing perfume or aftershave. Two reporters were banned. One admitted wearing deodorant and other had eaten mints. Heather said her son noticed a gel on the door handle when she took him to school.

She returned home and tried to open the door without touching the gel But some of it brushed her little finger and she became dizzy. Slane, 28, denies assault. 

The case continues.
