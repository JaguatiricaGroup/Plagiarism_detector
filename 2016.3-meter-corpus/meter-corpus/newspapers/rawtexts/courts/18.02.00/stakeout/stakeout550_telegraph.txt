A POLICE officer who was badly beaten up when a drunk colleague failed to respond to his radio calls for help won his case for negligence against West Midlands Police yesterday.

David Mullaney, 34, was repeatedly kicked in the head and was left unconscious after the attack, which happened during a stake-out at a public convenience used by homosexuals in Coventry. The court was told that Pc Dermot McKirdy was meant to be monitoring radio messages, but was drunk and failed to alert colleagues.

Mr Mullaney, who has since resigned from the force, was left alone during the stake-out in March 1994. When a man exposed himself, Mr Mullaney tried to arrest him and a violent struggle took place in which his head was smashed into a grille and he was repeatedly kicked in the head.

Recorder John Mitting, QC, sitting as deputy High Court Judge in Birmingham, said: 'There was a serious dereliction of duty by Pc McKirdy and a cover-up of that dereliction of duty by the creation of a false log. The failure to hear and respond to four radio messages is due, I am satisfied, to Pc McKirdy's absence from his post. No explanation has been offered for that.'

The court was told that Pc McKirdy had since left the police after he committed a drink-driving offence.

The case was adjourned for a hearing to assess damages for Mr Mullaney, who was also awarded costs.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said it was considering an appeal.
