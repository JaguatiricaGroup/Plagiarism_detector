MYRA Hindley's lawyer said yesterday that it was 'inhumane' to lock up the Moors murderer and throw away the key.

Edward Fitzgerald QC said Hindley, 57, who has spent 33 years in jail, had reformed and was no longer a danger to society. He said it was inhumane to take away all hope of parole and pressed the Law Lords to give her another chance. He asked them to overturn an Appeal Court ruling supporting the decision by successive Home Secretaries that 'life must mean life'.

Mr Fitzgerald said that in 1966, when Hindley was jailed for killing Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17, no ruling was made on when she could be offered parole. 'No suggestion was made for the next 20 years that she would be subject to a whole-life tariff,' he added.

In a test case which could affect other killers, he told the five Law Lords it was illegal and unjust to tell Hindley in 1990 that she was being locked away for life when such a concept did not exist at the time she was sentenced.

He said Parliament had not authorised such a category of punishment and added: 'It cannot rationally be justified. There is no dispute that her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserved punishment, but there is uncontradictable evidence that she has reformed.'

He said that, in recommending a move to open prison, the Parole Board had confirmed Hindley had a case for parole. But, he argued, this could not properly be presented while she was still shut away for life.

Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has been asked to reconsider Hindley's sentence, has said he will await the Lords' decision.

The hearing continues.
