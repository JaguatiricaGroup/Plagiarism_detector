MOORS murderer Myra Hindley is no longer a danger to children and should be let out of jail, a court was told yesterday. 

The woman convicted of torturing and killing youngsters and recording their screams as they died has been made a victim, her lawyer said. 

Hindley, who has served 34 years behind bars, has turned to the House of Lords in a bid for freedom. Successive Home Secretaries have decided that in her case life must mean life but she is fighting the ruling.

Her lawyers are claiming it is illegal to condemn a prisoner to die behind bars. Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC said: 'There is no dispute her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserving of punishment. But there is uncontradictable evidence that she has reformed and presents no danger to society.' The test case, heard before five Law Lords, could have major implications for other killers.

But if Hindley's latest bid fails she will have exhausted all the channels open to her under domestic law.

It's thought she is willing to take her fight to the European Court of Human Rights if she loses the appeal.
