MOORS murderer Myra Hindley is a 'reformed' person who presents no danger to society, the House of Lords heard yesterday.

The child killer, who is challenging the decision that her life sentence 'must mean life', was the victim of a 'basic injustice', said Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC.

He told the five Law Lords that condemning 57-year-old Hindley to die in prison with no hope of parole was unlawful. Hindley has been in jail since May 1966 following her conviction at Chester Crown Court of the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17.

'There is no dispute that her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserving of punishment,' Mr Fitzgerald said. 'But there is uncontradictable evidence that she has reformed and presents no danger to society.'

Hindley is challenging a Court of Appeal ruling in November 1998 which upheld the decision of successive Home Secretaries that her life sentence 'must mean life'.

Mr Fitzgerald said Hindley had a case for release, which was confirmed by the Parole Board when it recommended her move to an open prison, under domestic law.
