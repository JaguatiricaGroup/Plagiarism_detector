MOORS murderer Myra Hindley should be released from prison, her lawyers said yesterday.

She is no longer a danger to society and has become a reformed character, it was claimed. Hindley, 57, who faces dying behind bars after Home Secretary Jack Straw confirmed a 'whole life' sentence on her, was appealing to five Law Lords.

Her lawyers said she was being treated with 'unique severity' and claimed Straw's decision was 'inhuman and degrading' punishment.

But Home Office lawyers will contest her appeal.

The challenge comes after the Court of Appeal said the Home Secretary was entitled to say life means that because her offences were so horrendous. It does not mean Straw can throw away the key. But the Appeal Court said that Home Secretaries could refuse to free her in their five-year reviews if they felt public confidence in justice would be dented.
