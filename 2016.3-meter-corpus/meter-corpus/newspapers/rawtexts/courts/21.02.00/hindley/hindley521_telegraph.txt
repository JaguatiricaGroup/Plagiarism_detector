MYRA Hindley, the Moors murderer, suffered 'inhuman and degrading treatment' because successive Home Secretaries decided she should spend her life in prison, the House of Lords was told yesterday.

Hindley, 57, in her 35th year of imprisonment, was a 'reformed' person who presented no danger to society and the decisions to rule out release, save in exceptional circumstances, were unlawful, irrational and 'disproportionate', said Edward Fitzgerald, QC, her counsel.  He asked five law lords to overturn the Appeal Court's upholding of Michael Howard's and Jack Straw's decisions of a 'whole life' tariff for her murders with Ian Brady of two children, and being an accessory to Brady's murder of a third.

After she was convicted with Brady at Chester Crown court in May 1966 and jailed for life, she was given a provisional 'tariff' that she should serve a minimum of 30 years for retribution and deterrence before being considered for parole.

This was increased to 'whole life' after she admitted in 1987 that she had been guilty of murdering all three of the children and a party to murdering two others.

Mr Fitzgerald said it was a fundamental injustice to impose a whole-life tariff in 1990 when such a concept did not exist when Hindley was sentenced.

'There is no dispute that her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserving of punishment, but there is uncontradictable evidence that she has reformed and presents no danger to society,' he said.

The hearing is expected to last four days before judgment is reserved.
