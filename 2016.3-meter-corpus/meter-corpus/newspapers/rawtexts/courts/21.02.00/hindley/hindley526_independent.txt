MYRA HINDLEY yesterday began her latest attempt to overturn the decisions of successive home secretaries that, in her case, a life sentence should mean life.

In the House of Lords her legal team argued that after 29 years in prison Hindley, 57, was no longer a danger to society. Her barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, QC, said it was inhuman and degrading to 'throw away the key' on someone imprisoned so young.

The Moors murderer was 23 in May 1966 when she was sentenced for two killings.Hindley's sentence was increased to 'whole life' shortly after she confessed in 1987 to being party to the murders of Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12. In November 1998, three judges at the Court of Appeal in London unanimously dismissed Hindley's appeal against her lifelong tariff, the decision that she is challenging in the Lords.

Mr Fitzgerald told the five law lords: 'There was no minimum recommendation at her sentencing. There was no suggestion for 20 years that she would be subjected to a whole life tariff'.

The case before Lords Browne-Wilkinson, Nicholls of Birkenhead, Hutton Steyn and Hobhouse of Woodborough, is expected to last four days.
