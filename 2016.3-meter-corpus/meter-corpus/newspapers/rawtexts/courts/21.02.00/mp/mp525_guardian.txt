A disgruntled constituent was yesterday jailed for two weeks for sending a maggot-infested mouse through the post to her MP. Mother-of-two Mee San Lee-Reed, 50, sent the decomposing rodent to David Jamieson, Labour MP for Plymouth Devonport, with a note that read: 'Nazi scum, you are dead'.

The package was opened by Mr Jamieson's wife at their home last July, Plymouth crown court heard. Lee-Reed also sent a dead rodent to Plymouth city council offices, the court heard.

Lee-Reed, of Plymouth, pleaded guilty to two charges of sending indecent or obscene material and asked for four other offences to be taken into consideration.

Hugh Cornford, prosecuting, said Lee-Reed had also sent dog faeces and sanitary towels covered in tomato and soya sauce to people against whom she had a grudge. In mitigation, Nick Lewin said Lee-Reed felt let down by her MP in her efforts to find out more about the murder of her relatives in her native Indonesia. She held a grudge against Plymouth city council following a rent dispute, which caused her losses of £40,00O, he added.
