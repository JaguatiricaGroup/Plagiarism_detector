A POLICEMAN was caught on camera 'bouncing' a man's head off the back windscreen of his panda car, a court heard yesterday. PC Michael Anthony Hughes, 36, denies assaulting Adam Lamonby while arresting him for being drunk and disorderly in Bournemouth last April.

Weymouth magistrates were shown a closed circuit television recording of the alleged assault. Prosecuting solicitor Gareth Evans said Pc Hughes's partner appeared to try to stand in front of the lens. Mr Lamonby was later released without charge. 

The case continues.
