A WATER firm was fined £250,000 yesterday after a road flooded with five million gallons of sewage and industrial waste.

Residents, woken in the early hours by the smell of chemicals, suffered nausea and stinging eyes and mouths, a court heard. So much damage was caused by the spill in November 1988 that the firm, Thames Water, offered to buy the 31 houses in the road at Erith, Kent. It pleaded guilty to letting waste enter the water supply and allowing pollution likely to harm human life.

Croydon Crown Court heard a pump had sent sewage the wrong way and three others failed.

Judge Cedric Joseph said: 'The company has a dreadful record and I take an extremely serious view of this offence'.

Thames has spent £2.5 million in compensation, buying properties and other expenses.
