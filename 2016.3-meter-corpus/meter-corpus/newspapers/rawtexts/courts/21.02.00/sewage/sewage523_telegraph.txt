A WATER company was fined £ 250,000 yesterday for allowing millions of gallons of raw sewage and industrial chemicals to flow into the Thames before sending it into family homes.

Ten families were evacuated as their houses were flooded with the sludge in November 1998. Many of the men, women and young children had to be treated in hospital for acute short-term symptoms associated with the chemicals. Although none suffered long-term physical effects, their homes have not been habitable since.

Eight of the houses in Erith, Kent, have since been bought by Thames Water and are being refurbished. The former occupants, some of whom have options to buy back once refurbishments are complete, are living in rented accommodation paid for by Thames Water. Thames Water pleaded guilty to the charges at Bexley magistrates' court on Jan 14 but the magistrates committed the case to Croydon Crown Court for sentencing. 

The company was fined £200,000 for disposing of waste in a manner likely to cause harm to human health and £50,000 for polluting the Thames. The company was also ordered to pay £13,000 costs.

The Environment Agency. which brought the case, has prosecuted Thames Water 24 times since 1995, with 20 hearings relating to allowing sewage into watercourses.
