RIGHT-WING fanatic David Copeland was not mentally ill when he planted nail bombs in London's Soho which killed three people, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph told the jury Copeland, 24, was suffering from a personality disorder but still had the 'choice, willpower and ability to decide whether or not to carry out the bombings'.

Copeland denies murder. 

The trial continues.
