A POLICE officer was fined £500 and may lose his job for calling model Naomi Campbell's aunt 'a flat-nosed monkey'. 

PC Peter Ferguson, 42, aimed his taunt at WPC Sonia Campbell, 36, a colleague at London's Kensington police station. Magistrate Shamoon Somjee was told at Tower Bridge court that Ferguson also told WPC Campbell she looked like 'she could have gone six rounds with Mike Tyson'.
