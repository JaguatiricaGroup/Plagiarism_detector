The two men behind the ostrich farming scam of the mid-1990s were convicted yesterday of fraud charges relating to attempts to exploit public fears about mad cow disease. They will be sentenced later today.

Their convictions mark the end of the ostrich mania that followed official admissions of the potential danger of eating British beef.

Brian Ketchell and Allan Walker, founders of the Ostrich Farming Corporation, had been charged with conspiring to defraud investors in an ostrich breeding scheme. Their trial at Leicester crown court began in March. Walker and Ketchell initially denied the charge, but changed their pleas to guilty on March 28. The two men, from Nottinghamshire, set up the business in 1994-95, promising investors huge rates of return from buying ostriches which they said would become a popular source of food.

The business eventually attracted more than 2,800 customers and within 15 months had a turnover of £21m. Instead of buying ostriches, however, millions of pounds of investors' money was siphoned into offshore accounts. Neither of the men bought ostriches themselves as a personal investment, while between them they received more than £5.5m. Two men were acquitted of helping to run the scam, brothers, Kevin and Russell Jones.

The company took many orders, but in many cases the ostriches were non-existent. Of the 3,456 supposed birds sold to customers or allocated under the farm's guaranteed chick scheme, at least 925 did not exist. OFC was wound up in early 1996 by the Department of Trade and Industry on public interest grounds. The SF0 began its investigation just over four years ago. Members of the public bought ostriches at prices ranging from £1,400 for a chick to £14,000 for a mature breeding bird. According to the SF0, 'The sales literature promised significant rates of return on breeding birds'.
