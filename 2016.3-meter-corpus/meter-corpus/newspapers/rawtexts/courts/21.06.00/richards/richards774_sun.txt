THE former Tory leader in the Welsh Assembly told cops he did not punch a blonde he met in a pub, a court heard.

Rod Richards, 53, ex-Tory MP for Clwyd, said he had taken the woman and her sister back to their flat for cash to repay him for a meal. He is alleged to have attacked Cassandra Malvin, 23, breaking her elbow, after her sister Tiffini rejected his sexual advances in North Sheen, South-West London.

He said of the injuries in an interview with police: 'They are nothing to do with me. I did not touch her.' Richards, of Heol Isaf, Radyr, near Cardiff, denies GBH. 

The hearing at Kingston Crown Court continues.
