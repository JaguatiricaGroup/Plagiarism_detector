A FORMER Tory minister accused of punching a girl in the face yesterday admitted having a conviction for violence.

Welsh Assembly member Rod Richards told Kingston Crown Court he had been found guilty of actual bodily harm after punching a fellow cab driver in the face in 1975 during a fight while he was a student.

Richards also admitted 'chatting up' Cassandra Melvin, 23, and her sister Tiffini, 31, at a pizza restaurant in Richmond, South-west London. Richards, 53, of Cardiff, denies assaulting Cassandra, causing her grievous bodily harm, outside her sister's flat in Kew in July last year.

The trial continues.
