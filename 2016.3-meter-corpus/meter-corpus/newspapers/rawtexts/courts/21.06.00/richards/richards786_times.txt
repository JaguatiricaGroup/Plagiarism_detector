A FORMER Tory minister admitted in Court yesterday that he was a fool to go back to the flat of two sisters and try to chat them up. Rod Richards, 53, a father of three, admitted that he had 'not ruled out' having a sexual relationship with either Cassandra or Tiffini Melvin.

Giving evidence at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court, Mr Richards disclosed that he had a conviction for assaulting a taxi driver when he was a student. He had also failed to tell police of the conviction when he applied for a firearms certificate.

The court has been told that the Welsh Assembly member punched Cassandra Melvin, 23, in the face before hurling her against a parked car outside the flat in Richmond, southwest London, breaking her arm. She had thrown him out of the flat after he had bought them a meal at a restaurant in the town. Mr Richards denies causing grevious bodily harm to Cassandra Melvin in July last year.

He said that it was a 'pretty foolish thing' to go back to the women's flat and he could 'hardly believe' that he had done so. Asked by his defence counsel, Baroness Mallalieu, QC, whether he had tried to chat the women up, he said: 'Yes, to be frank, in a chatty, teasing sort of way.' He added: 'There was no suggestion from either girl that they were remotely interested.'

They had gone back to the flat for coffee. "The atmosphere had been fine all evening. Suddenly, apropos of nothing, the mood changed and Cassandra walked into the room and said 'Right, it's time you were leaving'."

He said that she grabbed hold of him, pulled him to his feet and pushed him into the communal hallway. He was 'squeezed' between the front door and its frame. 'I pushed the door back and turned to leave. I felt a push behind me.' 

The trial continues.
