A POLICE sergeant who raped two women and indecently assaulted three more was jailed for 18 years yesterday.

Evil Paul Banfield, 33, broke down in tears as he was sentenced. Mr Justice Morland said: 'You subjected your victims to humiliating and terrifying experiences to satisfy your squalid sexual depravity.' 

'In doing so, you caused them great distress which I am satisfied has resulted in them suffering prolonged psychological stress.'

'To them you were a person of authority. You were falsely friendly towards them before you sexually assaulted them in the most gross breach of trust and decency.'

Banfield carried out the attacks between September 1998 and October last year while serving with Cambridgeshire Police as a custody sergeant.

He raped a 45-year-old divorcee after breaking into her house, Nottingham Crown Court heard. She had inadvertently told him her address as she chatted to him while he sat in a police van in the centre of Cambridge while she was on a night out.

The beast also raped a woman who was being held in cells at Parkside police station, Cambridge. He indecently assaulted two other women being held in cells there and indecently assaulted a former girlfriend at her home. Police chiefs fear that Banfield, of St Neots, Cambs, might have attacked other women who are too traumatised to come forward.

Assistant Chief Constable Tom Lloyd said: 'Banfield is a sexual predator who used his position of considerable authority and trust to target and attack women in a vunerable position.'

'Thanks to their courage he is now behind bars. Where we can tighten procedures we have and will continue to do so.'

'Banfield's victims have suffered appalling experiences. To them I offer my sincere apologies on behalf of the force.'
