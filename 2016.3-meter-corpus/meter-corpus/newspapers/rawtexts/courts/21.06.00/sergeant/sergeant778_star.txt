EVIL cop Paul Banfield yesterday wept in the dock as he was jailed for 18 years for raping two women and sexually assaulting three others. Banfield, 33, raped one woman in a police station cell while he was on duty as custody sergeant. He attacked another in her own bed after breaking into her home, knowing she was already a terrified burglary victim. And he told another victim who begged him to leave: 'What are you going to do, call the police?'

Banfield had to be supported by guards in the dock at Nottingham Crown Court as Mr Justice Morland told him: 'As a sergeant you must have realised what an ordeal the five women who were victims of your crimes had endured. 'You subjected them to a humiliating and terrifying experience.'

Last night Banfield's boss - Cambridgeshire's Deputy Chief Constable Tom Lloyd - said: 'He is a sexual predator who used his position of considerable authority and trust to target and attack women. His victims have suffered appallingly, and to them I offer my sincerest apologies on behalf of the Constabulary'.

One victim said last night: 'I will never forget what he did to me. It haunts me every night.' Detective believe Banfield may have attacked other women yet to come forward.
