The jury in the "beauty in the bath" murder trial was sent home yesterday when it failed to reach a verdict after three and a half hours' deliberation at Liverpool Crown court. John Taft, 49, of Birkenhead, Merseyside, denies strangling Cynthia Bolshaw, 50, and dumping her body in the bath at her home in Heswall, Wirral, on Oct 8, 1983.
