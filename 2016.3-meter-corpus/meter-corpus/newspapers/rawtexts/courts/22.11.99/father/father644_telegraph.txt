A TRUSTED bookkeeper who stole £101,717 from a firm of solicitors to provide medical treatment and a private education for his handicapped daughter escaped being jailed yesterday because he had paid back every penny plus interest.

The family of Paul Hyams, 43, of Edgware, north London, was said to have been hit by several unfortunate mishaps, the worst of which was his daughter's severe learning difficulties.

Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, said at Southwark Crown Court that because Hyams was such a trusted employee the solicitors he worked for did not realise that he was issuing cheques for his own benefit. After his arrest in 1998, he and his wife sold their home and insurance policy to raise £150,000, all of which was paid back to the solicitors. He was sentenced to 18 months, suspended for two years, after admitting 16 offences of obtaining money by deception. Another 31 offences were taken into consideration.

The judge said that if Hyams, who has obtained a good job as assistant to a property company, were jailed his daughter would suffer. A combination of circumstances made it a most unusual case. He told Hyams, who had stood with his head bowed in shame: 'You may now leave the dock.'
