AN international sprinter was found dead in a hospital bed while undergoing treatment for psychiatric problems, an inquest heard yesterday.

Sophia Smith, 24, who represented Britain in the World and European championships, was discovered with her face down in a pillow.

Dr Christopher Wallbridge, a psychologist, told the hearing of Miss Smith's mental condition on the days before her death last April at Nether Edge hospital, Sheffield.

'She believed she was on a mission from God and had to die to save the world.'

'During the day she was on a five-minute watch, but at night it was a half-hour check through the window of her room. This was to allow her to get some sleep because she had been distressed and had gone without sleep.'

Dr John Clarke, a pathologist, told the Sheffield hearing that there had been abnormalities in Miss Smith's brain cells which indicated that there had briefly been a lack of oxygen.

He said it could have been caused by a heart beat irregularity or through her airways being blocked while lying face down.

He felt it highly unlikely she had been subjected to any assault and nothing in her medical history gave a clue to the cause of death.

Miss Smith, of City Road, Sheffield, had been given anti-psychotic drugs with known side-effects that had to be a consideration.

Dr Clarke said: 'The most serious one could cause the heart to stop beating. It is in medical literature, but no one has proved the association precisely or found the cause.'

Prof Robert Forrest, a forensic toxicologist, found no evidence of an 'acute inappropriate' overdose.

He said the length of time between her last being given the drugs and her death made it 'less rather than more likely' that they had any relationship to the cause of death. 'But I don't think it could be excluded totally.'

The hearing continues.
