THE doctor who exposed the Bristol baby heart op scandal broke down yesterday as he paid tribute to children who died.

Tearful Dr Stephen Bolsin said he wanted the bereaved parents to know 'that for me they were all individual children who had families'.

Head bowed, the consultant anaesthetist added: 'I am sorry for what happened to them.'

Dr Bolsin, 47, was speaking at the public inquiry into 2,000 operations on babies at Bristol Royal Infirmary.

He flew in from Australia, where he now works after allegedly being frozen out in Britain for revealing the scandal in which 29 babies died. Dr Bolsin described the heart unit at Bristol as 'a train which kept going - even though passengers were falling off'.

He said surgeons continued to operate on children despite high death rates because hospital chiefs wanted to keep the unit's status as a centre of excellence - guaranteeing extra cash.

He added: 'The commitment of staff was to keep doing the things they felt were important to designation, irrespective of risk to patients.' Surgeons James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana and former hospital chief executive Dr John Roylance were found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the General Medical Council.

Dr Bolsin told the inquiry that by the early 1990s he became worried over death rates and by 1992 no longer wanted to be associated with it.

He said Mr Wisheart warned him not to speak out 'if he valued his career'. Dr Bolsin said the threat came in 1990 after he had written to Dr Roylance about his concerns over the rate of deaths.

He said: 'I went up to see Mr Wisheart - he had the letter on the desk in front of him. He made it clear this wasn't the way I should carry on.'

The Bristol hearing continues.
