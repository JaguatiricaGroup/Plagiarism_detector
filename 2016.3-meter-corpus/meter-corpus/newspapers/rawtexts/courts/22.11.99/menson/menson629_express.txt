POLICE ignored pleas from the family of a black musician, allegedly murdered in a racist attack, urging them to interview him as he lay dying in hospital, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

Alex Menson, the sister of Michael Menson, who died after being set alight in Edmonton, North London, in January 1997, said she had checked with nurses to make certain he was fit to talk to the police. Michael, the son of a Ghanaian diplomat, had claimed a gang of white youths attacked him, but detectives thought he had tried to kill himself and did not take a statement. Mario Pereira, 26, and Charalambous Constantinou, 26, both from Edmonton, deny murder.

The trial continues.
