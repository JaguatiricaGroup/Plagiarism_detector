A black rock musician who died after being set on fire in an alleged street attack told his brother he took off his clothes and rolled on the ground to try to put out the flames, an Old Bailey court heard yesterday.

Kwesi Menson said his brother Michael, 30, told him that he was attacked by white youths near a telephone kiosk in Edmonton, north London. Harry Constantinou, 26, and Mario Pereira, 26, deny murdering him. Both men, and unemployed Husseyin Abdullah, 50, deny charges of perverting the course of justice by hindering the police inquiry.

Kwesi Menson said he made notes of what his brother said during visits to him in a hospital specialist unit where he underwent operations to treat burns covering 30% of his body. Michael Menson died two weeks after being found on fire.
