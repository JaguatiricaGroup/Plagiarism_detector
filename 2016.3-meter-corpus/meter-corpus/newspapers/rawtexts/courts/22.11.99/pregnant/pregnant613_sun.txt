PSYCHOPATH Brian Smith was jailed for life yesterday for stabbing his girlfriend in the stomach in a bid to kill their unborn baby.

Smith, 26, lay in wait for Amanda Hunter as she went to a hospital appointment after dumping him. He dragged her to the ground and stabbed her six times.

Two blows pierced her womb, cutting her unborn son's buttocks. Amanda, 21, was rushed into surgery. Her 7lb son Bailey was delivered by Caesarean section 30 minutes after the attack, which hit the headlines last November.

Both mum and baby made a full recovery.

Smith admitted wounding with intent and attempting to destroy the life of an unborn child at Newcastle Court.

Amanda said: 'It's a great relief. I still have nightmares. I just want to concentrate on Bailey.'
