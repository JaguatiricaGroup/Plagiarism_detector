A MAN who stabbed his pregnant girlfriend and tried to kill their unborn child was yesterday jailed for life.

Evil Brian Smith was branded a 'danger to women' after the frenzied attack on Amanda Hunter.

Amanda, 21, only escaped death because her vital organs were protected by 7lb 4oz Bailey.

The trainee nurse, who was knifed repeatedly in the stomach and chest during the prolonged assault, said yesterday she was 'overjoyed' as Smith was given two life sentences.

She added: 'It's a great relief. It is everything I could have hoped for. I still have nightmares and knowing he's locked up for a long time means I can sleep easy.' Prosecutor Paul Batty, QC, told Newcastle Crown Court the attack was the worst anyone could imagine.

He said: 'This was a frenzied assault with a kitchen knife on Amanda Hunter, who was eight months pregnant, which resulted in life-threatening injuries and led to her baby having to be delivered by emergency caesarean section.'

Bailey was born with two cuts to his buttocks and is still scarred.

Smith, 26, of Sunderland, admitted wounding Amanda and attempting to destroy her unborn child in the attack at the town's Royal Hospital.
