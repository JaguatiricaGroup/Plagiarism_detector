A MAN who stabbed his pregnant girlfriend, wounding their unborn child, was given two life sentences yesterday.

Brian Smith, who has a string of convictions for assault on women and attempted rape admitted attacking Amanda Hunter with a 3½in blade as she attended a hospital antenatal clinic. It penetrated her stomach and chest, cutting the baby twice in the buttocks.

Newcastle Crown Court was told that an emergency team at Sunderland Royal Hospital was forced to deliver the baby, two weeks premature, immediately after the attack. Miss Hunter, 21, a trainee nurse, survived because her vital organs were protected by her 7lb 4oz baby son, Bailey.

Smith, 26, stabbed his girlfriend last November after she ended their relationship. He had threatened her with a knife two days earlier.

Passing sentence yesterday, Mrs Justice Hallett recommended that he serve at least eight years before applying for parole.

Miss Hunter said later. 'It's a great relief. I still have nightmares about what happened and knowing he's locked up for a long time means I can sleep easy.'
