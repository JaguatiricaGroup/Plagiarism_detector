A CAR salesman who killed a doctor while showing off a high-performance car at almost 90mph was jailed for nine months yesterday.

David Goodwin lost control of the Subaru Impreza Turbo during a test drive with David McBeath on a country road in Perth. Dr McBeath, 29, from Kinross, who was considering buying the car and was sitting in the front passenger seat, was killed when it smashed into a BMW.

Goodwin, 36, from Glendoick, Perthshire, had pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving on May 18 this year.

Sheriff Fiona Reith told Perth Sheriff Court yesterday that she had no option but to jail Goodwin as a warning to other motorists who drove dangerously. 'This must have been a horrifying experience, with terrible consequences for Dr McBeath's wife and family,' she said. Goodwin was also disqualified from driving for three years.

Outside the court, Malcolm McBeath, David's father, said: 'No sentence, however severe, will make up for the loss of our son and we cannot help feeling angry and bitter about the circumstances of his death. This is a waste of a young life.'

The court was told that Dr McBeath, who worked at the Loch Leven Health Centre, had asked to test drive the £21,000 Subaru from Anderson Cars in Perth. Goodwin, who had been with the company for only a few months, wanted to demonstrate the power of the Impreza. After hitting the BMW, the Subaru was thrown into the air, landing in a field. Dr McBeath's body had to be cut from the wreckage.

John MacEachern, for the defence, said that Goodwin had suffered post-traumatic amnesia and could not remember the crash. He was dismissed from the company after the accident.
