A TOP dancer is suing a hospital for £8 million damages after childbirth left her a wheelchair-bound mute. Kerstin Parkin, 31, suffered severe brain damage as she save birth to her first child Dylan, now three, the High Court was told yesterday.

The mum and husband Mark, 40, claim a catalogue of failures by staff at Farnborough hospital in Orpington, Kent. Mark said: 'She has lost so much already, I can't see why she should lose out on any more family life.'

The former Latin American dancer, rated among the top six in the world, was left unable to walk, talk or care for herself. Mark, a choreographer, has had to give up work to look after her. Kerstin, of Bramley, Surrey, suffered a fit then a heart attack.

She claims an unacceptable delay by midwives in calling for a cardiac arrest team. Bromley Hospital NHS Trust admits liability.

The hearing continues.
