Dancer Kerstin Parkin, whose career ended after she suffered brain damage during the birth of her first child, began an £8m damages claim against an NHS trust yesterday.

In the high court, Mr Justice Buckley was shown a video of Kerstin dancing with her husband Mark when they were leaders in Latin American dance competitions, followed by footage of her being treated in a hospital bed. She must now spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair or bed, cannot talk, and has to have 24-hour care. Her husband, who gave up his career to look after her, has settled his £800,000 claim for post-traumatic stress against Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust for an undisclosed sum. John Grace QC, representing the pair, said the event that 'devastated their lives' came when Kerstin was 27 and in labour during the birth of her first child at Farnborough hospital, near Orpington, Kent.

Mr Grace said the pair danced professionally and her husband was for eight years ranked among the top six in his field in the world. Their son, Dylan, now three, is being looked after by family, friends and nannies at a cost so far of £25,000. Kerstin is now at a rehabilitation unit in Godalming, Surrey, the court heard. The hearing continues.
