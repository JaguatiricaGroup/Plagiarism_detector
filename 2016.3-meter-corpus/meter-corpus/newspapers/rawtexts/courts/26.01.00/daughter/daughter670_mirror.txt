A MOTHER yesterday won a landmark legal battle for her mentally handicapped daughter to undergo a hysterectomy to protect her from unwanted pregnancy.

The 54-year-old mother, a widow, claimed the operation was the most effective way for her attractive 28-year-old daughter to be fully protected.

Last night Mencap, the charity for the handicapped, condemned the decision as 'an extreme measure' based on social not health grounds.

But High Court judge, Mr Justice Wall ruled the op was in the girl's best interests.

It was agreed by doctors that a pregnancy would be disastrous.

Her mother opted for a hysterectomy rather than sterilisation because the girl suffered physical problems.
