The official solicitor is to ask the court of appeal to veto a hysterectomy for a 28-year-old mentally handicapped woman after a high court judge ruled that it would be in her best interests for the operation to go ahead.

Laurence Oates, who acts for those unable to look after their own legal interests, believes the woman should not have to undergo such an invasive procedure but should be fitted with a contraceptive coil to prevent pregnancy and deal with heavy periods. Mr Oates said: 'Clearly it is an issue which we feel needs to be considered by the court of appeal as soon as possible. 

The issue is whether a less invasive method of treatment is in her best interests. It is right for the court of appeal to give us guidelines.'

The woman's 54-year-old mother, a widow, fears her daughter could become pregnant when she moves into a residential home, either through forming an emotional attachment with another resident, or through somebody 'taking advantage' of her or raping her. She wanted her daughter to have a hysterectomy because this would not only protect her from pregnancy but put a stop to her periods altogether. But the official solicitor argued that a Mirena coil would be a simpler, easier and less invasive option. Last Monday Mr Justice Wall held that the operation could go ahead. The judge said that the daughter, identified only by the initial S, though an 'extremely attractive young woman' was incapable of managing and administering her own affairs. She lives with her mother and attends a day centre five days a week. But the mother finds coping increasingly difficult and hopes that within 12 months S will get a permanent placement in a home.

The judge said it was common ground amongst all who had examined or come into contact with S that pregnancy would be disastrous for her.

'She would have no understanding of what was happening to her.'
