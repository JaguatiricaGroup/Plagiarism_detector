A driver who 'drank himself into oblivion to obliterate the memory of what had occurred' after he knocked down and fatally injured a 15-year-old girl was sentenced to four months in prison and banned from driving for two years by Norwich magistrates. Norman Yeomans, father of the dead girl, Lorna Yeomans, said afterwards that he was 'disgusted' at the sentence. Nick Methold, for the prosecution, said that James Billman, who admitted failing to stop after the accident, had carried on drinking the next day and had gone to the police 30 hours later.
