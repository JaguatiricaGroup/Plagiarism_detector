DAVID IRVING, the Hitler historian, challenged in the High Court yesterday the credibility of evidence of Auschwitz survivors.

The veracity of Henryk Tauber, a Jew forced to work in the crematoriums, stretched 'a reasonable historian's credibility', he claimed. Mr Irving, 62, who is suing Deborah Lipstadt, an American academic, and her publisher, Penguin Books, for libel over her claim that he is a Holocaust-denier, pointed to Tauber's eye-witness accounts of one Jew set alight with petrol by the SS and another thrown into a pit of boiling human fat.

This was the sort of 'lurid' evidence that should be open to more than normal scrutiny, Mr Irving said during his cross-examination of Robert Van Pelt, a Dutch Auschwitz expert. Mr Irving suggested that Tauber's 'precision' was prompted by the Polish authorities. But Professor Van Pelt described the evidence as plausible.

According to further evidence he gave after his liberation, Tauber helped to incinerate the corpses of up to 2,500 Greek, French and Dutch Jews a day in Crematorium 2 at Auschwitz. Tauber said he saw cyanide pellets poured into the gas chambers down small 'chimneys'.

But Mr Irving told Mr Justice Gray, sitting without a jury, that no homicidal gas chambers existed at Auschwitz. Eyewitness evidence had been 'totally demolished' because there were no holes discernible in the roof of the gas chambers.

Professor Van Pelt referred the judge to a photograph of February 1943 which, he said, showed openings above ground on roof.

The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.
