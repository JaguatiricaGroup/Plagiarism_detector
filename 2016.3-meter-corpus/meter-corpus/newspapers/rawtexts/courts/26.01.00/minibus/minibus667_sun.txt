A TRUCKER involved in a crash that killed five members of a pub soccer team had hospital treatment for a sleep disorder, a court heard yesterday.

Graham Jagger, 46 - whose lorry ploughed into the back of the team's minibus - had sleep apnoea in 1996.

Sufferers of the potentially fatal condition stop breathing while asleep.

Jagger, who denies careless driving, had been working 13 hours before the 1998 crash, which happened when the bus hit engine trouble.

The trucker, appearing at Hinckley court, Leics, could not answer accusations he fell asleep at the wheel as he has no memory of the crash. He sobbed at suggestions this was 'convenient.'

The victims, of Groby, Leics, were aged 21 to 30. The case continues.
