THE Belgian Government was criticised by the Home Office in the High Court yesterday over its legal challenge against Jack Straw's decision to send General Pinochet home to Chile. Jonathan Sumption, QC, for the Home Office, said: 'I must be careful what I say about a friendly foreign government but there were aspects which were surprising about the letter of request from the Belgian authorities.' He was commenting on Belgium's representations to Mr Straw after his recent provisional decision that he was 'minded' to allow General Pinochet to go home on medical grounds.

Belgium, whose extradition request was put on hold while the Spanish request was being considered, is demanding to see the medical reports by four British doctors, as well as the opportunity to have their own doctors examine the former Chilean dictator.

As the Belgian Government joined with Amnesty International to seek permission for a judicial review of Mr Straw's decision, Mr Sumption said that Belgium's letter of request for more medical evidence was a 'diatribe' against the Home Secretary.

He argued that Mr Straw had already disclosed much of the medical reports which had been carried out under assurances of confidentiality. He added: 'There is quite clearly no legal basis on which Senator Pinochet could be compelled to submit to examination by other parties.'

Presiley Baxendale, QC, for Belgium said that by keeping the medical reports secret Mr Straw was stopping Belgium and other parties from making proper representations. He was also preventing himself from making a proper decision.

At the beginning of the hearing Mr Justice Kay disclosed a potential link between himself and Amnesty International. He said that ten or more years ago it had been suggested to him that he was on a list of counsel approved by the human rights organisation and there bad once been a suggestion of him working on a case for it.
