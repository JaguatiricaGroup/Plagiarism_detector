A BOOZY businesswoman punched a Virgin Atlantic flight steward during a row over a reclining seat, a court heard yesterday.

Heather Tagg, 33, 'swung her fist' at James Morris when he intervened because she was arguing with another passenger.

Mr Morris said: 'As I approached they were arguing. There was some choice language, both were irate.'

The steward - who was hit in the shoulder 'wrestled Tagg to the floor by using a wrist lock. He told Croydon Crown Court: 'She had been drinking. We could smell it on her breath.'

Tagg calmed down and was confined to another seat after the scuffle. Police came on board when the plane - on a night flight from New Jersey - landed at Gatwick.

Tagg, from Battle, East Sussex, denies assaulting Mr Morris and his cabin crew colleague Elizabeth Voyce, allegedly pushed backwards over seats. Tagg - who ran a hat-making firm before moving to New York with her Time Warner executive husband - also denies being drunk on the aircraft.

She said she drank three cans of lager and a whisky and coke on the flight.

Tagg claimed the man sitting in front of her had inconvenienced both her and cabin crew by fully reclining his seat even before take-off.

The row erupted later as she played cards with men sitting next to her.

Tagg said the man in front insulted and tried to provoke her by accusing her of being drunk. She stepped into the aisle and was grabbed from behind by Mr Morris.

She added: 'My arm was in a straight arm-lock. He was trying to lift me in the air. It was really hurting - I had to get him off me.'

The trial continues.
