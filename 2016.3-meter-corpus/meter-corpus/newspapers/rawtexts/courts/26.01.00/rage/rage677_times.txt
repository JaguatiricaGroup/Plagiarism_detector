A DRUNKEN businesswoman punched an air steward on a transatlantic flight when he tried to intervene in an argument that she was having with another passenger, a court was told yesterday.

James Morris, a cabin crew member with Virgin Atlantic Airways, said that he managed to restrain Heather Tagg, 33, from persisting with her aggressive behaviour only by putting her in a wrist lock and wrestling her to the floor.

'She had been drinking. We could smell it on her breath, we could see bottles of vodka, miniature bottles that had been bought from the duty free and consumed on board. They were directly on her seat,' he told Croydon Crown Court.

He was speaking on the second day of a trial in which Mrs Tagg, from Battle, East Sussex, is accused of assaulting him and Elizabeth Voyce, a fellow crew member, during the flight last February. She is also charged with being drunk on board the aircraft.

Mrs Tagg said that Mr Morris had approached her from behind and tried to force her to the floor after an argument broke out between her and a man in front during an overnight flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Gatwick.

Mrs Tagg said that she was 'definitely not drunk at any stage' during the flight and had not assaulted any of the crew.

The case continues.
