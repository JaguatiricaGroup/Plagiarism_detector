A judge who presided at the trial of the retired British Rail ticket collector Anthony Sawoniuk - who was given two life sentences after becoming the first man to be convicted in the UK of Nazi war crimes- did not 'err in law', the Court of Appeal was told yesterday.

Sawoniuk, 78, who says that his Old Bailey trial was an 'abuse of the process of the court', is urging three judges to quash his conviction as 'unsafe'. The hearing continues.
