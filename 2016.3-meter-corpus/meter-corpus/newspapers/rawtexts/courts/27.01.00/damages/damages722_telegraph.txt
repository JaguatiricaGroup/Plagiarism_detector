An eight-year-old boy who suffered severe brain damage after medical staff failed to detect danger signals at his birth was awarded more than £2.9 million damages in the High Court yesterday.

The Northern General Hospital in Sheffield admitted that Luke Warren, of Skegness, Lines, would not have cerebral palsy if a caesarean section had been carried out earlier.
