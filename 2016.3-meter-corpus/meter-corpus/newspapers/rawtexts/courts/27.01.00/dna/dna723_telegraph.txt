A FATHER of four was jailed for life yesterday for a murder committed 15 years ago, but unsolved until DNA tests proved he was the killer.

Duncan Jackson was questioned soon after the murder of Avril Dunn, but remained free until 'staggering advances' in genetic fingerprinting gave police the evidence they needed to charge him.

At Reading Crown Court, Mr Justice Garland praised police and forensic scientists who gathered evidence against Jackson, 37, whose wife had said he was at home at the time of the murder.

Miss Dunn, 25, was beaten and strangled in a shed near her home in Luton, Beds, in April 1985.

A sample on her clothing was stored until DNA showed a billion to one chance that it did not come from Jackson, the court was told. He denied murder.
