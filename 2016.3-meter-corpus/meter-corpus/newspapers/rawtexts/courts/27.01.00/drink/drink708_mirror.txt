A BANNED drink-driver who ran down and killed a schoolgirl was jailed yesterday for seven and a half years.

Raymond Albert, 28, had spent the day in pubs, sinking at least six pints, when he got into a car that had cost him just £100.

A high speed police chase followed and he rammed two other cars and smashed into a bus shelter before hitting Lydia Morgan, 16.

The girl was walking on the pavement to her grandmother's house, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court in South Wales was told.

She was studying for A-levels and hoped to be a doctor like her father.

Albert was found to have more than three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood.

He was disqualified for a similar offence at the time of the tragedy.

Albert, of Merthyr, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and driving while disqualified, with excess alcohol and without insurance.

The judge told him: 'This is a bad case. No sentence can put right the permanent feelings of loss and devastation suffered by victims' families.'
