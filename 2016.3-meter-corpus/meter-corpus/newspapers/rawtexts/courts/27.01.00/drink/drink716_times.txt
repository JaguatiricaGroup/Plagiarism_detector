A convicted drink-driver who went on a day-long drinking session, drove out to buy cigarettes, then led police on a high-speed chase before running down and killing a 16-year-old schoolgirl was jailed for 7½ years. Passing sentence on unemployed Raymond Albert, 28, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, Judge John Curran said the families of victims of such offences suffered 'permanent feelings of loss, grieving and devastation'.
