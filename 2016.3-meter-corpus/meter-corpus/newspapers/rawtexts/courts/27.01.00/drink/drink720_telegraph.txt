A CONVICTED drink-driver who drank all day and then led police on a high-speed car chase before running down and killing a schoolgirl was jailed yesterday for seven and a half years.

Raymond Albert, 28, had driven to a garage in his home town of Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, to buy cigarettes. As he drove home he nearly hit another car and was seen by police. They followed him and he sped off after ramming two taxis, Richard Twomlow, prosecuting, told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court. Albert lost control of the car, which he had bought for £100, and smashed into a bus shelter before hitting Lydia Morgan, a 16-year-old A-level student. She later died of head injuries.

Albert, who was already serving a two-year ban for drink-driving, admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, driving with excess alcohol and driving without insurance.
