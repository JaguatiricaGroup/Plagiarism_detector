A convicted drink-driver, who drank all day then led police on a car chase before running down and killing an A-level student, was jailed yesterday for seven-and-a-half years.

Raymond Albert, 28, was serving a two-year ban when he caused the death of Lydia Morgan, 16, last September, Merthyr Tydfil crown court, in south Wales, was told. Albert, unemployed, had driven to a garage in the town to buy cigarettes when police saw his vehicle nearly hit another car. Richard Twomlow, prosecuting, said: 'The officers shouted for him to stop, which he did. As one officer got out of his car, Albert looked directly at him, took a drag on his cigarette and drove off at speed.' As police followed, he rammed two cars and forced some women to run out of his path.

He lost control of his vehicle and hit a parked taxi and a bus shelter before ploughing into Miss Morgan on the pavement. She died of head injuries. Albert was found to have 118 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.

He admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, driving with excess alcohol and driving without insurance. Judge John Curran said: 'No comment or sentence can ever put right the permanent feelings of loss, grieving and devastation which are suffered by the victims' families.'
