A CONVICTED drink-driver who went on a day-long drinking session then killed a schoolgirl in a high-speed police chase, was jailed yesterday for seven and a half years.

Raymond Albert, 28, was subject to a two-year drink-driving ban when he ran down Lydia Morgan, a 16-year-old A-level student.

Albert had spent the day in two pubs in his home of Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, and police noticed him nearly hitting another car. They followed Albert's £100 Rover 213 through the town centre but lost him when he sped away after hitting two taxis, the prosecution told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court.

Albert lost control of the car on a bend, smashed into a bus shelter then hit the girl, who was on the pavement. Miss Morgan, who had gained four GCSE A grades and five B grades and was studying maths, chemistry and biology A-levels hoping to become a doctor, died of head injuries.

Police found Albert trying to restart his car. He was more than three times above the limit. He said he felt 'dreadful' about the girl's death and wanted to apologise.
