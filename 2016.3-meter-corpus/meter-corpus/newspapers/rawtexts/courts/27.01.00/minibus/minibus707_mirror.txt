A LORRY driver who smashed into the back of a minibus, killing five youngsters on a Christmas night out, was banned for two years yesterday.

Graham Jagger, 46, who probably nodded off at the wheel due to a sleeping disorder, was also fined £2,500 in Hinckley, Leics, after being found guilty of careless driving.

Four members of a pub football team and their pal died in the crash near Measham, Leics, in 1998.
