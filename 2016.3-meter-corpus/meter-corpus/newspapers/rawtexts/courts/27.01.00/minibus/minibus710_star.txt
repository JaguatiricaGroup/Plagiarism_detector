A TRUCKER with a sleeping sickness who caused a crash that killed five minibus passengers walked free from court yesterday.

Graham Jagger, 46, is believed to have nodded off at the wheel of his 38-tonne lorry when it ploughed into the back of the 20-seater coach.

The smash killed four members of a pub football team and one of their pals.

The lorry's tachograph showed that Jagger, who had been at the wheel for 13 hours, had not braked or even changed speed for 14 miles until the collision, the court in Hinckley, Leics, was told.

Stipendiary magistrate David Meredith said he believed Jagger had fallen asleep. He told him: 'I don't believe you saw the minibus at all.'

Jagger, of Shipley, West Yorks, said he remembered nothing of the crash.

He was found guilty of careless driving and banned from the roads for two years, fined £2,500 and ordered to pay £500 costs.

The court was told that he suffered from sleep apnoea, a condition caused by obesity which led to drowsiness.

The accident happened on the A42 near Measharn, Leicestershire in December, 1998.

The victims were Steven Parker, 21, Paul Thompson, 22, and Panayi Kouroushi, 30, all from Groby, Leics; Steven Curtis, 28, of Newton Linford, Leics; and Jeremy Goodall, 30, of Leicester Forest East. They were on their way to a Christmas party in Tamworth, Staffs.

After the hearing, victim Jeremy Goodall's mother, Rosalind, said: 'I'm pleased with the guilty verdict. Someone needs to be held responsible for these five deaths.

'I'm pleased he got a driving ban, but no punishment will bring Jeremy back.'
