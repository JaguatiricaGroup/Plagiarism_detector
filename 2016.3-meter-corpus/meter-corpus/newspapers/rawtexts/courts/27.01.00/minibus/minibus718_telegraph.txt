A LORRY driver who caused an accident in which five young minibus passengers died was fined £2,500 and banned from driving for two years yesterday.

Graham Jagger, 46, had either fallen asleep at the wheel or lost concentration when his 38-ton lorry ran into the back of the slow-moving minibus, magistrates at Hinckley, Leics, decided.

Jagger, who has a sleeping disorder that causes drowsiness, had been driving for 13 hours before the crash on the A42 near Measham, Leics, in Dec 1998.

The crash killed four members of a pub football team from Groby, near Leicester, and one of their friends.

The were on their way to a Christmas party night out in Tamworth, Staffs.

Police found Jagger had not braked or slowed down before the impact and the lorry's tachograph showed that for 14 miles before the crash it had been driven at a constant 56 mph.

David Meredith, stipendiary magistrate, said this showed Jagger had fallen asleep or lost concentration.

Jagger, of Shipley, West Yorks, had denied driving without due care and attention.

Steven Curtis, 28, Jeremy Goodall, 30, Steven Parker, 21, Paul Thompson, 22, and Panayi Kouroushi, 30, died in the crash. The court heard the minibus had an unexplained defect and was travelling at 25 mph with dimmed rear lights.

Daniel Randall, 37, the minibus driver, survived the accident.
