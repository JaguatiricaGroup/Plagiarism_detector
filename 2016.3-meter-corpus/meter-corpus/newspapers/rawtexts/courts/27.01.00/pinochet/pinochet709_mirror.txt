HUMAN rights activists will learn next Monday if they can go ahead with a last-ditch legal move to stop Augusto Pinochet going back to Chile.

A High Court judge said yesterday he is to give a ruling then on permission to seek a judicial review of the case.

Home Secretary Jack Straw has indicated he will let the ex-dictator return to Chile on health grounds.

Human rights groups want Pinochet extradited to face trial in Spain on torture charges.

They claim Mr Straw should give them access to the medical reasons for his decision.
