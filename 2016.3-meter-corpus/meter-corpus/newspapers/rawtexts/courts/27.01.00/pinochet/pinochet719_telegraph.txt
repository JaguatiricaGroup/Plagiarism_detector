A HIGH Court judge will rule on Monday whether the legal battle over Gen Augusto Pinochet is likely to be prolonged or if Jack Straw can free him next week on compassionate grounds.

After hearing two days of submissions from the Belgian government and six human rights groups, Mr Justice Maurice Kay said yesterday that he would give his judgement on Monday morning.

He will decide whether to give Belgium and the human rights groups permission for a judicial review of the Home Secretary's intended decision to release Gen Pinochet, 84, without disclosing details of a medical report which concluded that he was mentally unfit to stand trial.

If he grants a review, the hearing is likely to take place later next week before two or three judges.

But if the judge rejects a review, the way will be open for Mr Straw to free the former dictator of Chile within 48 hours.

Both Belgium and the human rights groups, led by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, could appeal against the decision to three judges, but there were doubts last night that this would happen.

Louis Michel, the Belgian foreign minister, indicated that his country would not appeal or pursue the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
