A judge will rule on Monday whether the Belgian government and human rights groups can go ahead with a last-ditch legal challenge to Jack Straw's plans to allow Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on medical grounds. The Belgian authorities and six human rights groups applied to Mr Justice Maurice Kay for leave to seek judicial review. They argued it would be against the public interest if they were denied access to the medical reasons behind the home secretary's announcement that he is minded to halt extradition proceedings against the former Chilean dictator.

If the judge turns down the application the general could board a Chilean air force jet, waiting in Bermuda for Mr Straw's final decision, and return to Chile as early as next Tuesday. If Mr Justice Kay agrees the judicial review should go forward, it will be heard before three judges. The home office has said Mr Straw would reserve any decision until proceedings have been completed.

At the high court yesterday Presiley Baxendale QC rejected claims from lawyers for the home secretary that Belgium was not entitled to seek judicial review. The request was legally justified as Belgium - along with Spain, Switzerland and France - was actively seeking Pinochet's extradition.
