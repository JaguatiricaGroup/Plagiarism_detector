A DRUNKEN skipper whose 200ft cargo ship ran aground after he left the bridge unmanned to sleep was jailed for six months yesterday Newcastle Crown Court Judge Denis Orde told Chief Petty Officer Jerzy Pawluk, 42, it was only an 'act of God' that none of his six crew perished.

The ex-Polish Navy Lieutenant, was in charge of the 900-tonne MV Roustel, heading from Scotland to Teesside, but staggered back to his bunk after swigging whisky.

He put the ship on autopilot and it steamed through the night without anyone in control before running aground near Montrose in December, causing £100,000 of damage.
