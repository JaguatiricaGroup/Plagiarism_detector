A CALLOUS wife hired a convicted killer to batter her husband to death with a crowbar as he slept, a court heard yesterday.

Mother-of-two Sandra Jones, 38, hatched the plot with a former schoolfriend and planned to collect a £96,000 insurance payment. But her husband Clifford, 35, managed to fight off his attacker, despite suffering severe facial injuries.

Yesterday Mrs Jones wept in the dock at Stafford Crown Court as she was jailed for three years for conspiracy to murder.

The court had heard that Jones and her friend Julie Harvey, 34, both from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, forged her husband's signature to obtain a bank loan of £6,000 to pay hitman Matthew Lee, 53.

They recruited Lee after learning that he had committed murder in 1981 and served 16 years in jail.

The two women even discussed taking a holiday with part of the expected pay-out. Mr Justice Kay told them their friendship had turned a 'daft notion' in the back of Jones's mind into a reality. He added: 'Both of you lived for a period in a state devoid of reality. I also think that it was unfortunate that you happened to bump into somebody like Matthew Lee.' Harvey was sentenced to 18 months for conspiracy. Both women admitted the charges. Lee, who was found guilty of the same charge by a jury was jailed for life under the 'two strikes and you're out' law on serious offences.

Mr Jones, who works for the JCB machinery company said after the hearing he was 'sad' that he would have to break the news of his wife's imprisonment to their 13-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son. He had written to the judge urging leniency.

Mr Jones said: 'I get no satisfaction from this. It was not me who pressed charges. Matthew Lee had to go down as he is a danger to the public but as far as Sandra goes, it should never have got this far.' He denied a claim by his wife's counsel that he had been violent towards her.
