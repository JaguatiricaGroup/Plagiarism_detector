EX-dictator General Augusto Pinochet stood accused of 35 of the most serious torture and brutality charges to come before a British court, his long-awaited extradition hearing was told yesterday.

He sanctioned electric shock 'treatment' which led to victims' deaths, it was claimed.

And prosecutor Alun Jones said the 83-year-old former Chilean leader also authorised the interrogation of a naked woman, beatings, burnings and the use of mind-bending drugs.

Mr Jones added that relatives of 1,100 political opponents of Pinochet who vanished were also effectively tortured - as they were kept in the dark about their loved ones' fate. It took a clerk at London's Bow Street court 15 minutes to read out all the charges facing the general.

He was not there to hear them as he is still under armed guard at a mansion in Wentworth, Surrey.

A heavy police presence kept watch on rival pro and anti-Pinochet groups chanting outside.

Pinochet's extradition is being fought by Spain.

The general was arrested in London last year at the request of a Spanish judge who accused him of a string of human rights crimes allegedly committed while he ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990. The hearing continues.
