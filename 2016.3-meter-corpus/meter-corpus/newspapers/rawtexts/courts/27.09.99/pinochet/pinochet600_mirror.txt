TORTURE victims of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet faced the agonies of The Grill and The Telephone, a court heard yesterday.

They were allegedly given 'repeated and intense electric shocks' on The Grill to make them confess.

The Telephone involved hanging victims first by one wrist and then the other while they were beaten.

It took 16 minutes to read out 35 specimen charges against Pinochet, accused of some of the worst crimes to be heard in an English court. The 83-year-old, bedridden after a stroke, remained at his rented Surrey home on the first day of the extradition hearing at London's Bow Street court.

Alun Jones, QC, said tortures alleged to have been carried out in Pinochet's name included Russian Roulette, beatings, and threats of rape and murder to relatives.

One woman, Antonla Ninoles, was interrogated naked, kept in 'dark, solitary and insanitary conditions,' and deprived of sleep for five days. Patricia Irrazaval was forced to stand for 48 hours without moving while she was beaten and deprived of food and sleep.

Marcos Ruiz was made to stand with one arm in the air for seven days at the secret police headquarters in Santiago.

Spain is seeking Pinochet's extradition over the mass murder and torture of thousands of opponents during his 1973 to 1990 rule.

The ex-president, arrested when he came to London for medical treatment last year, says he had no hand in the crimes. The case continues.
