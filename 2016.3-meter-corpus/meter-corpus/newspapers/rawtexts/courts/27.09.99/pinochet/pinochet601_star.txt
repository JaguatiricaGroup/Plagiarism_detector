FORMER Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was officially accused of torture yesterday as the long-awaited extradition hearing against him opened. But the 83-year-old General, still under house arrest in Surrey, was not at London's Bow Street Magistrates' Court to hear the 35 charges he faces. It took the court clerk 15 minutes to read out the accusations.

They include allegations of torture involving brutal beatings and burnings, the enforced use of drugs, interrogating a naked woman and electric shock treatment which led to victims' deaths.

The Spanish authorities want him extradited to face trial on the charges. Alun Jones QC, opening the case for the Spanish authorities, said they were 'some of the most serious allegations of crime ever to come before English criminal courts'. The case continues.
