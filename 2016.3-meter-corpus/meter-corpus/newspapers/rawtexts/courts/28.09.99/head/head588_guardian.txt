A former private school headmaster accused of sexually abusing pupils was yesterday cleared of five of the charges against him at Bournemouth crown court. David Cassell, 56, was alleged to have assaulted four children at St Michael's preparatory school, near Barnstaple, Devon, between 1977 and 1982. He still faces five further sexual abuse charges relating to two other children.
