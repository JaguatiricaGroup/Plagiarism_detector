POLICE shot an unarmed man suspected of carrying a gun after he ignored warnings and turned towards them, an inquest was told yesterday. He was found to be carrying a chair leg in a plastic bag.

Henry Stanley, 46, from Hackney, East London, was shot in the head and the left hand by two crew of an armed police response vehicle who had been told he was carrying a concealed sawn-off shotgun as he left a public house.

Yesterday Detective Superintendent Bryan Craddock, a Surrey officer investigating the death, told the St Pancras inquest that a 999 call was made at 7:14 pm last Wednesday. The caller said a man had left the pub with a shotgun in a bag. When police arrived they saw Mr Stanley carrying a bag. As he entered a nearby street police challenged him. He ignored them and they called again.

Mr Craddock said the man still did not reply and turned towards the police. The two policemen opened fire and Mr Stanley fell to the ground. He was dead by 8.l2 pm. The inquest was adjourned.
