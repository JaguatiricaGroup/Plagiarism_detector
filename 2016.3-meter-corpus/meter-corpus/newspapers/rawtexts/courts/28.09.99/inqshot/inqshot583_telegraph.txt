POLICE shot dead an unarmed man when they mistook a table leg he was carrying in a plastic bag for a sawn-off shotgun, an inquest heard yesterday.

Henry Stanley, 46, died after being shot twice as he returned home from a pub in Hackney, east London, last Wednesday.

Det Supt Bryan Craddock, of Surrey police, who is leading the investigation into the shooting on behalf of the Police Complaints Authority, told the inquest that police received a 999 call reporting that a man had left the Alexandra pub in Victoria Park Road, carrying a sawn-off shotgun.

Armed officers were called to the area, St Pancras coroner's court was told. Two officers called out to Mr Stanley as he turned a corner.

When he did not respond, they challenged him again. He did not reply but stopped and turned around.

The two officers then fired a single shot each. Mr Stanley, a decorator who had been out of work due to ill health, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The inquest was adjourned and Mr Stanley's son, Jason, issued a statement in which the family called for an independent inquiry.

Describing the circumstances of the shooting as 'very disturbing', he said 'From everything we have heard we have major concerns about the way my father was killed.'
