The family of a unarmed man shot dead by police who believed he had a gun yesterday called for an independent inquiry into his death.

Henry Stanley, 46, from Hackney, east London, was shot in the head and the hand by two officers in Hackney on September 22 as he returned home from a pub, St Pancras coroner's court heard.

An investigation into the shooting is being led by Detective Superintendent Bryan Craddock, of Surrey police, on behalf of the police complaints authority.

Det Supt Craddock said that at 7:l4 pm on the day of the incident, police received a call from a person who said a man had left the pub carrying a sawn-off shotgun in a bag. 

Two officers from an armed response unit saw a man fitting the caller's description and carrying a plastic bag, Det Supt Craddock said.

They shouted to him, but he did not reply. When he turned, the officers shot him. The item in the bag was later found to be a table leg. The inquest was adjourned for further investigation. A second post mortem was carried out by the Police Federation and the dead man's family are to have a third post mortem conducted. 

Mr Stanley's son, Jason, said: 'The family is devastated. We are pushing for a full, independent inquiry'.
