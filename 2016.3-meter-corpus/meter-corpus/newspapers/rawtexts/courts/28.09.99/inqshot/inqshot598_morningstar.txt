THE family of an unarmed man shot dead by police demanded yesterday that an independent inquiry be held into the killing.

Londoner Henry Stanley was shot in the head by two officers in Hackney last Wednesday as he returned home from a pub.

After an inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court, Mr Stanley's son Jason said that the family were 'devastated' at losing a father in such 'disturbing' circumstances.

'It is impossible to put our grief into words. We are pushing for a full, fair independent inquiry,' he said.

'From everything we have heard, we have major concerns about the way my father was killed.'

Detective Superintendent Bryan Craddock, who is in charge of the Police Complaints Authority investigation into the shooting, described the events leading up to Mr Stanley's death.

He told the inquest that police had received a 999 call to say that a man carrying a sawn-off shotgun in a plastic bag had just left the pub.

Two armed officers later spotted Mr Stanley, who they said fitted the description of the suspect.

Mr Craddock told the inquest that the officers challenged him twice, but he failed to respond. He said that the suspect then turned to face them and they opened fire.

The item in Mr Stanley's plastic bag turned out to be a table leg.

Pressure group Inquest, which examines deaths in custody, said that it was concerned about police firearms training and backed the family's call for an inquiry.

'This shocking case must be subjected to full, independent public scrutiny,' said inquest co-director Deborah Coles.

There have been two other fatal shootings this year by armed officers.

Police have appealed for witnesses to last week's shooting to come forward. It is thought that an elderly couple may have seen the incident.

The inquest was adjourned for further investigation after coroner Stephen Chan declared the cause of death as a shot to the head.
