LAWYERS for Chile's former dictator General Pinochet urged magistrates yesterday to strike out the overwhelming majority of the torture charges against him.

On the second day of the general's extradition hearing at Bow Street, they argued that the court could not consider allegations filed after an original extradition request.

Clive Nicholls QC, for Gen Pinochet, argued that the court could only concern itself with offences described in an original extradition request.

The general, who is under armed police guard at a rented mansion on the exclusive Wentworth Estate in Surrey, is not attending the extradition hearing.

His lawyers also argued that the charges against the general made it clear that the alleged tortures had been carried out physically by other people.

Yesterday's court developments came as Chile announced that it would take Spain to the United Nations' top court in a bid to halt the extradition.

Chile will ask the International Court of Justice to rule that Spain's judiciary cannot judge him.

'We are planning to file an application and to institute proceedings against Spain,' said Chile's legal adviser Jaime Lagos.

The general has been excused from the hearings on the grounds of ill health, but must be present when a decision is announced by magistrate Ronald Bartle, probably two weeks after the extradition hearing ends on Friday.
