A MAN fined over a road rage bust-up in a car park has had his conviction quashed - because a magistrate dozed off during the case.

The unnamed JP had to be woken - then later fined Timothy Price, 26, £500 and ordered him to pay £300 in compensation.

Price's solicitor lodged a complaint. The Crown Prosecution Service yesterday confirmed a new trial would have to be held at Witney in Oxfordshire.

Chief prosecution witness Sandy Strover fumed: 'I feel totally let down.' The mum vowed she would not relive her ordeal in the witness box, adding: 'Giving evidence was absolute torture.'
