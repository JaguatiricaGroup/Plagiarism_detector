A MAGISTRATE who nodded off during a road rage trial is facing disciplinary action. He fell asleep while hearing how a man caused fear by threatening violence against a pregnant woman in a parking place row.

Timothy Price of North Leigh, Oxon, was fined £500, but is appealing after hearing about the dozing magistrate. A Lord Lieutenant's committee, which reviews alleged misdemeanours, is now investigating the unnamed JP's case.
