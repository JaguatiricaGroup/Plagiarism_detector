A man convicted of road rage is to have his case reheard after a magistrate on the bench at Witney, Oxon, had to be woken up by a colleague.

Timothy Price, 26, was found guilty of causing fear of violence following an argument over a parking space but claimed he had been denied a fair hearing.

Tim Brown, Price's solicitor, complained to officials after noticing that the magistrate had his eyes shut during his closing address. 'I thought at first he was just pondering a point. I realised he had fallen asleep when he had to be shaken awake by the chairman of the bench.'
