A man's conviction in an alleged road rage case has been quashed after a magistrate fell asleep in his trial, it was disclosed yesterday. Timothy Price, 26, will have to face a retrial next month after his solicitor reported the incident during the hearing at Witney magistrates court in Oxfordshire. The crown prosecution service yesterday said a new trial would take place after the court confirmed the claim to be true. The sleeping magistrate has not been identified.

Mr Price, of North Leigh, Oxon, was convicted of causing fear, and provocation of violence, in July, following an alleged road rage incident in Witney's Woolgate Centre car park. He was fined £500 and ordered to pay £300 in compensation.

Tim Brown, his solicitor of the firm Brown and Pajak, said: 'A magistrate fell asleep and had to be woken up. It is only fair to have a retrial.'

Sandy Strover, a chief witness for the prosecution, told the Oxford Mail that she had only recently given birth to her daughter and would not be prepared to relive the ordeal.

She said: 'Giving evidence was a bad experience which I do not want to go through again.  I've only recently had an operation and have a tiny baby to look after.

'I am not prepared to go to court again.  It's an absolute shambles and I am furious. I feel totally let down by the system. If a magistrate fell asleep I can see the man did not have a fair trial. But giving evidence was absolute torture.'

Banbury court office, which covers the Witney area, had referred the matter to the lord chancellor's office.
