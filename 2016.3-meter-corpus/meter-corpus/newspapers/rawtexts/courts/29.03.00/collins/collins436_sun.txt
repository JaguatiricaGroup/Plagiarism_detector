PHIL Collins yesterday launched a court battle against two backing musicians - claiming he overpaid them £500,000 in royalties.

His lawyers say horn players Rahmlee Davis, 51, and Louis Satterfield, 61, were paid for all 15 tracks of a live album recorded on his 1990 Serious tour. But they claim the musicians - once in 70s supergroup Earth, Wind and Fire - should have been paid for just five tracks.

London's High Court was told an accounting error meant each man had been overpaid £250,000 in six years.

Oscar-winner Collins, worth £l00million, is not asking for the cash back. Royalty payments were stopped four years ago. Most of the cash has been recovered. But Davies and Satterfield, who say they are penniless, are suing for the full amount. The case continues.
