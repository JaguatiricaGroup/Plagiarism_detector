PHIL COllINS yesterday launched a court action against two members of his former backing band, claiming he OVERPAID them £500,000. Collins wants to stop shelling out royalties to the pair, who say they will be left destitute if they receive no more money. Collins insists an accounting error led Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis to be given too much for a live album recorded in 1990.
