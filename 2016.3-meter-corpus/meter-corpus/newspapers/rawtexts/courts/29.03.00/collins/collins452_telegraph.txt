PHIL Collins, the Oscar-winning pop star, claimed the return of £500,000 in overpaid royalties from two backing musicians in the High Court yesterday.

The two horn players from the group Earth, Wind and Fire are counter-claiming for unpaid royalties from recordings of Collins's 1990 Serious tour of America.

The singer, who wept when he won an Oscar on Sunday for his song You'll Be in My Heart from the cartoon Tarzan, was not at court.

His counsel, Robert Howe, told Mr Justice Jonathan Parker that Collins was not asking the two musicians 'to put their hand into their pockets'. Instead, Collins, who is said to be worth £300 million, wanted to recoup the losses from royalties earned since the alleged error was discovered.

Rahmlee Davis, 51, and Louis Satterfield, 61, were paid about £100,000 each to support Collins on the nine-month tour, said Mr Howe.

It was then agreed to pay them royalties from the live recordings. They received $517,000 (£323,125) each over six years, until accountants for Phil Collins Ltd decided they had been overpaid by about £250,000 each and stopped payments.

Mr Howe told the judge that the musicians believed they were entitled to be paid royalties for 10 tracks on which they had not appeared.

The hearing continues.
