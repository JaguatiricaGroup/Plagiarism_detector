TWO veteran criminals given a retrial on robbery charges because of concerns about alleged corruption among Flying Squad officers were cleared at the Old Bailey yesterday when the new hearing collapsed.

Judge Geoffrey Grigson, who was to preside over the retrial, threw out the charges after hearing that the Crown wanted to proceed without the officers, who are now facing corruption charges or disciplinary investigations.

The prosecution had not wanted to call the officers, including the detective in charge, but to rely on a statement about investigations into them.

Judge Geoffrey Grigson ruled that John Woodruff, 63, and William Hickson, 56, both from east London, could not have a fair trial if the Crown produced only a 'sanitised' version of the facts.

Woodruff and Hickson, who both had substantial criminal records, were jailed for 17 years in 1997 for conspiracy to rob, robbery and possessing firearms following an armed raid at an east London post office in 1996.

The pair were said to have stolen two parcels containing £32,500 in cash.

They claimed that evidence against them was fabricated and they were granted a retrial last year after the Appeal Court heard about investigations into Flying Squad officers.
