GOLD digger Sylvia Paterson used charm and ruthless cunning to drag herself from humble beginnings to the high life.

Her eye for the main chance transformed her from a council house girl to a Jet-setter with two planes, two Rolls-Royces, a Mercedes and two Range Rovers.

Flamboyant Sylvia drove each car with her own £20,000 personalised number plate - CLASSY.

She was born In Kent, but her mother deserted the family.

Sylvia spent time in a children's home because her father could not cope with her and her three sisters.

She was later cared for by three spinster aunts and went on to marry a soldier, David Bardsley. The couple had a daughter, Julie and son, Tyrell.

Sylvia trained as a nurse, working alongside top doctor Patrick Steptoe to produce the world's first test tube baby.

Her first taste of the good life came when she got a Job worth £200,000 a year as a personal assistant to a Lebanese tycoon.

She Jetted round the world and It wrecked her marriage.

But she was in love with luxury and was determined to keep the lifestyle. She sent Julie, now 34, and Tyrell, now 28, to public school. Sylvia invested in property in Cheshire and met John Holmes.

They teamed up to form a property development company.

She boasted of regularly jetting to the US on Concorde. Holmes respected her business sense and told the court 'She is extremely clever. She Is one of the best negotiators I have ever met.'

Paterson was able to buy her own £650,000 home in upmarket Wilmslow and met retired company boss Ken Paterson at a local pub.

She then set her sights on becoming his wife and heiress. But her relationship with Ken's son Paul and his wife Sarah descended Into hatred and they traded insults in a flurry of faxes.

Ken, 77, was reduced to seeing his grandchildren in secret behind Sylvia's back.

The couple have started divorce proceedings but Ken stood by her and was called as a defence witness during the trial.
