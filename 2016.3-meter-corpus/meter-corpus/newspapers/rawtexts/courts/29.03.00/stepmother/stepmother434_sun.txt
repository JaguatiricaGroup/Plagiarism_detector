BANJO the Clown looked every inch a figure of fun - but under the greasepaint was a ruthless conman who spent much of his life behind bars.

He served time in Canada, Britain and Denmark. He was drummed out of the British Army three times and booted out of the Foreign Legion.

Paul Thorlsog boasted of having been in the SAS and claimed to have been a 'Dog of War' in Middle East hot spots.

And he claimed to have been a stunt man in the James Bond movie Live And Let Die - jumping out of a plane on an exploding motorcycle.

In truth, his only talent apart from crime was for art.

He impressed John Holmes and other inmates in prison by making Samurai figurines out of bread.
