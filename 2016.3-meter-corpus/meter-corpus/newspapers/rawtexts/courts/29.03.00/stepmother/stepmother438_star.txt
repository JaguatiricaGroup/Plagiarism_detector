BANJO the 'hitman' clown IS facing his THIRTEENTH new identity after telling detectives he fears for his life. The circus funnyman at the centre of a murder trial juggled a life of crime with dressing up to make kids chuckle.

Banjo - alias 49-year-old villain Paul Thorlsog - got round-the- clock protection in a police safe house after agreeing to be chief prosecution witness.

He was considered such a target for a revenge attack that when he was giving evidence he was brought in through the Judge's chambers. Yesterday wealthy businessman John Holmes, 43, and friend Sylvia Paterson, 55, were caged for nine years each at Manchester Crown Court for attempted murder.

They had offered Banjo £40,000 to kill her stepson Paul Paterson and his wife Sarah - unaware he was taping them.

Holmes met Banjo in prison. Holmes had indecently assaulted a waitress and the clown had stolen his own disabled SON'S invalid carriage.

Banjo used 12 different aliases to dodge police while working as a clown - including Barry Bennell and Paul Yanjaysogthokslog.

Three times he joined different Army regiments under three different names.

And three times he was booted out with dishonourable discharges.

He did a runner from the French Foreign Legion, and has been jailed in FOUR different countries - England, Scotland, Denmark and Canada.

He was born plain Paul McMahon in Liverpool. His father's name is missing from his birth certificate.

One policeman said: 'He'd sell his gran down the river. You can't call him a Walter Mitty - that's being too nice to him.'
