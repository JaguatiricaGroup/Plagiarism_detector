OASIS are topping the charts again - after Be Here Now was voted 1999's LEAST wanted album.

Despite shifting 700,000 copies within three days of release, a Melody Maker poll found it was passed on to second-hand shops more often than any other album last year.

The band's B-sides compilation The MasterPlan also appears at No 9.
