OASIS'S Be Here Now has topped a chart as the least wanted album of last year just two months after Noel Gallagher admitted there were only three decent songs on it.

The album was 1997s fastest seller, but last year became the record most sold to second hand shops. Oasis beat off K by the now defunct Kulashaker and Spiders by Scouse band Space for the dubious top spot in the survey compiled by music mag Melody Maker.
