CATHERINE Zeta Jones' hopes of marrying at her family church in Wales have been dashed - because it is too small.

The 30-year-old actress dreamed of a fairytale wedding to Hollywood's Michael Douglas at the Clyne Chapel, near her old home in Mumbles. Catherine worshipped there as a child.

But it holds just 100 people and has no parking. A source said: "Catherine's realised it's too small. They both have a lot of friends and family who want to be there. "It would be a nightmare situation if everyone tried to cram into that tiny chapel."

"They are now considering other churches in Swansea near her parents' home. She certainly doesn't want a glitzy Hollywood wedding."

Catherine is also desperate for her elderly grandmother Zeta to come to her wedding and see her walk down the aisle. Zeta, 83, is the Entrapment star's biggest fan - but she was too sick to travel to America to go to Catherine's birthday party last September.

Michael, 55, is still waiting for his divorce from wife Diandra, 41, to be finalised. But he should be free to wed in six months. Diandra got a £44million settlement.

But as The Sun revealed yesterday, Catherine will sign a deal which means she does not get his fortune if they split. Meanwhile, Catherine was celebrating yesterday after finalising a multimillion pound film deal.

The Initial Entertainment Group agreed to put up £400million for her to produce up to 12 films which they will then distribute.

Catherine, who now commands £6million a picture, will star in most of them.
