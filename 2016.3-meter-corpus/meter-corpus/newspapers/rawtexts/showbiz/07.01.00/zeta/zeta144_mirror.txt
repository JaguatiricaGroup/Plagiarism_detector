STUNNING Catherine Zeta Jones has signed a £250million deal to make Hollywood movies, it was revealed last night.

The Mask Of Zorro star, who announced this week she is to marry Oscar-winner Michael Douglas, will produce up to 12 films with brother Lyndon. The pair's company Zeta Films will receive between £5million and £50million for each movie from US-based Initial Entertainment Group.

The deal was arranged by Catherine's other brother David - a senior lEG executive. And the Welsh actress said last night: "IEG has assembled a great work force and I look forward to being part of the team." 

Douglas, 55, proposed to Catherine, 30, on New Year's Eve at his home in Aspen, Colorado. Friends believe they will marry at Clyne Chapel near her family's Swansea home on September 25.
