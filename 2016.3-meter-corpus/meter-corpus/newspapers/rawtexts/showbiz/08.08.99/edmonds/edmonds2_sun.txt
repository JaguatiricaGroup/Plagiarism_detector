NOEL Edmonds yesterday announced he is quitting the BBC - because he no longer finds their shows "stimulating."

The ex-Noel's House Party host, who is walking out after 30 years, said he did not rule out a TV comeback if the right offer came along.

His spokesman said: "He is only 50 and has a lot of life left in him."
