TOP Gear TV presenter Brendan Coogan has quit his "dream job" after being convicted of drink-driving. Coogan, 28, brother of comedian Steve, admitted driving with excess alcohol in his blood the morning after a drinking session. He was banned for a year on Monday at Huddersfield.

"I never knowingly drink and drive," he said later.
