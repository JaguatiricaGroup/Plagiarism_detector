IT'S Obi-Clan Kenobi! Heart-throb Ewan McGregor looks out of this world in a kilt at the premiere of the new Star Wars film last night.

Ewan, 28 - Obi-Wan Kenobi in The Phantom Menace - joined ten-year-old co-star Jake Lloyd at the event in London's Leicester Square, attended by Prince Charles. And as Charles might say:

"Obi-Wan really enjoyed Wan-self."
