EASTENDERS star Craig Fairbrass quit the series because he reckoned his hardman character was starting to look like a "ballet dancer". The actor, whose character Dan Sullivan departs next week, told Now magazine that at first he loved playing the rat who two-timed Carol Jackson with her daughter Bianca. But after he was rude to Peggy Mitchell and got beaten up by her husband Frank. he decided to quit. "It was, 'Has Dan become a ballet dancer overnight?'" said Fairbrass.
