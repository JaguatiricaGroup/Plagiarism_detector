SIMPSONS mania is to hit Britain with a stage show featuring the "real" stars. The actors who provide the voices will read from classic scripts in Edinburgh and London in August, to mark the TV toon's 10th anniversary. They include Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Nancy Cartwright (Bart) and Hank Azaria (Moe the bartender).
