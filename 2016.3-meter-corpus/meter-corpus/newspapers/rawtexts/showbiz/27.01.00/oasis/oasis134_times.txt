NOEL GALLAGHER became a father yesterday after his wife, Meg Mathews, gave birth to a girl. The child, named Anaïs after Anaïs Nin, the French author, was born two weeks early after an induced labour at London's Portland Hospital. The Oasis star admitted that he had burst into tears at the emergence of his daughter, who weighed 7lb 2oz.

However, Gallagher, 32, quickly regained his composure and retired to a nearby pub, where he toasted the birth with a pint of Guinness.

Ms Matthews, 33, drank champagne with her family in hospital. She remained in hospital overnight, but Gallagher hoped that she would be able to accompany him to Mike Tyson's fight in Manchester tomorrow. He said: "I'm really proud of Meg. She looks fantastic - like she has just been shopping. A baby girl is what I was hoping for, as I have never had a sister."

Anaïs, who was conceived at Christian Dior's house in Montreux, was said to share her mother's blonde hair and blue eyes. She will soon share a playpen with Lennon, the five-month-old son of Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit, who was named after the Beatle. Gallagher, who had threatened to call the baby "Fanny", deferred to his wife, whose favourite author is apparently Nin. A leading figure in the "new feminism" of the 1970s, Nin published a series of avantgarde erotic novels, including A Spy in the House of Love. She died in 1977, and is best known for the erotic diaries of her affair with the author Henry Miller.

The songwriter had expressed reluctance to attend the birth, fearing that it would be "Exorcist material". Afterwards, he said: "I'm still shaking. I thought there was going to be lots of screaming and shouting all the way through, but there wasn't."
