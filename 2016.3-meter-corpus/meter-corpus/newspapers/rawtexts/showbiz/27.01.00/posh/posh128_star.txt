POSH Spice Victoria Beckham WAS worried about losing so much weight that she went to her doctors, she reveals tonight.

On Michael Parkinson's BBC1 show she admits: "They just said it's something that happens sometimes when you have children." Posh says speculation she might have bulimia made her so paranoid she was left bursting to go to the loo after dinner recently "because people are going to think you're throwing up".
