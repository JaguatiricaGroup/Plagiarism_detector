Royal Ballet star Darcey Bussell, (above) greeted early arrivals at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London, yesterday morning as tickets went on sale for the new season. Scores of opera and ballet lovers had spent the night on the pavement to secure seats. The main auditorium will reopen with a gala celebration on December 4 after a £214 million revamp.

To meet the demand for tickets, the Opera House has opened a 24 hour phone booking service, which continues until 8am tomorrow.

The redevelopment costs are being financed through a £78 million national Lottery grant, proceeds from sales of shops in the new building complex and a £100 million appeal.
